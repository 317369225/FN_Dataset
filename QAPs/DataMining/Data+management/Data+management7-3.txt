What are the hot and/or important topics in cloud data management and cloud computing research?
It is hands down Cloud Security. The Cloud is an efficiency and scale game changer and the biggest computing shift since distributed servers took on mainframes. But in an era with sophisticated zero day exploits and a constant arms race between rootkit creators and DDOS attackers and the security companies and state actors, security is at front of the debate. The incorporation, movement, mirroring, archiving and retrieval of data across hybrid clouds requires a security paradigm that is still evolving. This story is far from over. You may also want to look at Government as a service. Not citizen services from the cloud but creating a cloud which runs a government. Coming from an emerging market to me an offering which automates ministries and the running of government in an on demand transparent manner is a real innovation that can increase the quality of governance by many hundreds of percent. You just install this cloud in the IT ministry's data centre and let them provide it as a service to other government departments.    Embed Quote
