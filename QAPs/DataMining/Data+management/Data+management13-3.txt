Non-Profit Technology: What is a good volunteer data management program?
VolunteerMark, Maximizing the Volunteer Experience allows you to manage events with different shifts (with specific start times and ends times and roles) and then you can send out group emails and/or text messages to the entire event or to specific shifts.  It is really easy to use.   It even has a mobile app for the volunteers to use for free.    Embed Quote
