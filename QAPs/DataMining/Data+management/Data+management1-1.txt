What is the best master data management software right now?
There is no magical tool that "solves" MDM. Some tools have more flexibility in their data models, some have better workflow tools, some are easier to maintain, some are easier to implement. MDM is done so differently in different organizations that I can't see how anyone would declare any tool as "the best" for everyone. In my experience the success of MDM projects relies more on being able to on-board users into the new system and adapting the processes around data than on the "MDM" tool of choice. I've seen projects built on top-tier MDM solutions where years & millions were spent only to have users rejecting the system and working around it.    Embed Quote
