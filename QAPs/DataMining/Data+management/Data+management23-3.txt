Which vendor has progressed the most towards unified data management, through the merging of ETL, MDM and DQM?
I've been following the DataCleaner community for the last few years and noticed there quite a progress from "pure Data Quality" towards a much more unified platform with both ETL and some MDM aspects. Obviously, being entirely open source and so, it's no Informatica grade solution for the largest of enterprises, but it does impress and excell in certain areas such as monitoring DQ metrics, scheduling and managing ETL jobs etc. And there's also a Pentaho integration if you prefer using DataCleaner with a traditional ETL tool. What's interesting to me though, is more that there's a DQ tool progressing towards a ETL-ish (light, as they call it) space.    Embed Quote
