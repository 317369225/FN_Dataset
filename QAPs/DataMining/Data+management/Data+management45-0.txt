What is a list of benefits that a Data Management Platform (DMP) can provide a Publisher?
The biggest benefit that publishers typically see through the use of Data Management Platforms is the ability to segment granular audience data, making the site’s ad placements more valuable to advertisers and allowing the publisher to earn higher CPMs.    By leveraging DMPs, publishers can more effectively segment and analyze their target audiences by analyzing their own first-party data as well as supplemental third-party data. As they analyze the gathered visitor data (industry, interests, purchase history, etc.), publishers can develop audience segments and sell those segments to advertisers or other media buyers, enabling them to target consumers that fall under each segment category.   Once the publisher has segmented its site traffic, it can respond to RFPs for both exchanges and advertisers with custom segments that are already built, and earn a higher CPM because of the detailed audience segments.    Embed Quote
