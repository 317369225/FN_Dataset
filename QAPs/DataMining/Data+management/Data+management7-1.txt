What are the hot and/or important topics in cloud data management and cloud computing research?
One of the most pressing issues that is not well addressed in cloud storage today is creating distributed (LAN or WAN) block stores that are suitable for use with virtual machines. There are some unique challenges here, including the I/O patterns of typical virtual machines (heavy random small I/O workloads that also often require write-order durability and sync-write mechanics). There are various open-market solutions for distributed stores (hadoop, many others) that are ideally suited for large datasets but do not perform adequately for virtual machine use. Additionally, VM installations for cloud hosting also often  demand copy-on-write and zero-copy cloning support, features which are not adequately represented in the market solutions. Some things to look at are the Google Filesystem (GFS) and things like DRBD. The real problem to solve though: how to put VMs on commodity hardware at a low-cost such that failure of individual nodes does not impact the VM.    Embed Quote
