Which vendor has progressed the most towards unified data management, through the merging of ETL, MDM and DQM?
Informatica is the single vendor who is inching towards a holistic ETL+MDM+DQM. I can't see anyone coming close. MDM When Informatica bought Siperian, they were at version 8.6.1. Now Informatica is at 9.0.1, which means a better integration with Siperian and Identity Resolution. DQM Data Quality has been in Informatica's kitty for a while. Now it has matured as a product and very well integrated with PowerCenter (Infa's ETL product and its mainstay) ETL Infa's PowerCenter is the ETL tool and the company's mainstay. A lot went into Infa's ETL expertise and now it is at a point where it can process almost any filetype, database source or any source system. Infa's B2B and Data Transformation products are great for unstructured file processing. Integration with Salesforce.com and other sources/targets is a breeze. Infa 9.0.1 is a major step towards integrating all the acquired products under a single umbrella.    Embed Quote
