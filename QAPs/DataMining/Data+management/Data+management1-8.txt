What is the best master data management software right now?
This is a question that has no easy answer.  The bottom line is that a tool evaluation is required to get to the answer - taking into account the functional capabilities (based on the specific data domains that you wish to Master, the number of data sources, the quality of source data, the maturity of your governance program etc.), the total cost of ownership and the technical implementation required.  Each of these vendors that show up in the Gartner and Forester rankings grew up as PIM or CRM vendors - meaning they focused on mastering Product data or customer data.  Over the years, they have added the capability to master other domains - but they tend to be strongest in one area.  So, it is important to keep this in mind.  If your primary need is to master Product data then evaluate tools that started as PIM products, since that is their sweet spot.  Same goes for Customer domain.  MDM implementations are complex, so make sure you are taking into account the data modelling capabilities in the tool, the business process management capability, the match and merge function, the data quality and profiling aspects etc.  The more you can get out of the box - with minimal customisation the better.  Also, keep in mind that some of the tools use the standard relational models while others use object relational or object models.  The later are far more flexible and provide the ability to model complex relationships with ease. So, the bottom line is that one has to start with the domains you wish to master, whether you are willing to live with the out of the box functionality provided in the tool or not, the modelling and UI development aspects of the tool, the total cost of ownership and the integration costs.  Most firms are looking at mastering multiple domains - so if that is your requirement then you should start with products that are multi-domain MDM products.    Embed Quote
