What is clinical data management?
Clinical Data Management (CDM) is a discipline or function within a clinical research organization or group of a research company (pharmaceutical, medical devices, etc.).  The discipline functions mostly to manage the clinical data within a research study.  Their main functions include development of case report forms CRFs (or electronic CRFs), reviewing and cleaning data that a research site will enter on a form or via eCRFs, responding to issues with the data via queries back to the research site, and finally closing a database where the data is hosted referred to as "Locking a database". This of course is the 10,000 ft, description but I hope it helps you along the way.  There is an industry group specific to CDM that is a great resource not only for Data Managers but other disciplines within clinical research.  The website is Society for Clinical Data Management. Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
