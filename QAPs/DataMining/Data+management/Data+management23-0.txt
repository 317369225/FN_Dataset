Which vendor has progressed the most towards unified data management, through the merging of ETL, MDM and DQM?
From my experience SAP BusinessObjects has the most mature offering.  DataServices 4.0 has functionality for data quality management, data cleansing,  name disambiguation and for developing rules to continually cleanse incoming data.  I am using the APIs to cleanse data in real time as operators enter data in a call center.   To monitor the integrity of a database, SAP had a product called Information Steward, which can assess the quality of the data in rows and columns and report on problems on an ongoing basis.  In fact the profile of the quality of a database with the Information Steward product can provide a roadmap for a data quality initiative.    Embed Quote
