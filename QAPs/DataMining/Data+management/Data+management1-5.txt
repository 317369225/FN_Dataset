What is the best master data management software right now?
My experience has been mostly with Informatica MDM (Siperian) and IBM Infosphere MDM Server. While both of them are very capable products, I have seen Informatica MDM to be the preferred product for companies in the pharmaceuticals domain. Banking and Retail companies typically prefer MDM products from IBM or SAP. As a result, I think it is very difficult to declare a universal winner among MDM products. At the end, the choice is often a function of preference of the IT team of any organization, the industry the firm operates in, MDM vision and capabilities that the organization desires from MDM.    Embed Quote
