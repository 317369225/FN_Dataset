What is a good Master Data Management system on cloud software?
Most of the answers here don't address the question -- cloud-based solutions.  Talend, Tibco, Aeigis are all on-premise with a little research. Merchantry (Retail Product Information Management Cloud Software) is a cloud-based Product Information Management system designed specifically for retail, in particular mid-market and enterprise retailers and brands. There are varied definitions of MDM vs PIM, to be honest even the industry experts we work with (internally and externally) don't have consensus on the terms. There are several good on-premise solutions such as Heiler and Stibo but generally they require 7-figure engagement and long lead times.    Embed Quote
