★How can I convey domain knowledge to developers?I run a complex business and am hiring some developers to write some tools for me(I already made working prototypes myself in java/python) but I'm having trouble communicating the business/industry specific domain knowledge to the developer. I know the format of software specs but how can I learn how to explain things better to people who have no knowledge of my business domain?
There are several techniques I use to do this (Disclaimer: Am a programmer but am the Domain Knowledge guy in Hedge Funds): - Don't try to talk like they do or use their words, use your domain words and phrases, explain each one when you can, and they will eventually learn the phrases - Focus on the 80% (the core), ignore the exceptions, oddities, "if this then that" states; you can and will come back to them - Tell the same story three ways     [1] Top town, start with the big picture ("We make widgets"), and break it down into smaller and smaller parts     [2] Then start at the bottom ("The raw materials arrive") and walk your way to the big picture (Top down and bottom up reinforce the framework of your domain knowledge)     [3] Walk the flow of a process or thing through the business, from start to finish, through all its transitions ("Then we polish the widget'). Start with simple flows with no branches and expand (given the context of top-down and bottom-up, this provides the 'use' of the domain knowledge, and leads to a spec) - Be patient, it took you years to gain this knowledge, they will not get it in one conversation Hope this helps.    Embed Quote
