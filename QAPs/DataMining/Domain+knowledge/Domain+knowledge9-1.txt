There are four types of skills needed in product management to define and deliver products to market. The four types of expertise are: * Domain * Market * Technology * Business In my experience, agile product owners tend to have technology experience. Many product managers have business experience (42% have an MBA). Product marketing managers need market experience to create go-to-market plans and artifacts. In general, I'd say that domain expertise is the area that is weakest for most B2B companies.   Here's a story from my ebook: A vice president at a bank created a method for detecting fraud. He was recruited by a vendor to develop a product based around his domain expertise. But because he also had market expertise of the industry—he’d been a bank vice president after all— the sales team hounded him for sales calls. The sales people said, “I need you to come talk about banking issues with my buyers.” For nine months he was the darling of the sales people... until the day he resigned. His goal was not to be the guy who could “talk bank” to help generate sales of other products; his goal was to protect banks from fraud using his algorithm.   Many product managers attempt to support their teams with all four types of knowledge but it’s rare to find all of these capabilities in a single person.   Read more in my ebook Product Management Expertise at Ebook: Product management expertise    Embed Quote
