★How can you get hired as a product manager in a field where you have little or no domain knowledge? Would you hire such a person?Are you that person with a story?
I was hired a few years ago in an industry that I had very little experience - eCommerce and online advertising.  The path that I took to get that job was to focus on my actual accomplishments in prior jobs, and point to the fact that a reliable, predictable, and repeatable approach to product management will be successful no matter what the domain.  I pointed out that while I didn't know eCommerce, I knew agile development, product management, customer outreach, problem definition, and every single tool that I'd built for the prior 10 years or so as a PM.  I was quite open and honest about needing to rely on some of the internal experts as I gained my footing in the market, but also that within 6 months I'd be capable of running the product primarily on my own, as I built my own network of customers and users.  It was a great job, and I got to work with one of the best dev teams I've ever seen.    Embed Quote
