★How important is domain knowledge to data analytics?
Don't let the other answers deter you from analytics or the idea of working in consulting. There are many crossovers between different fields - for example in Market Research I know the types of questions I need to ask from experience (I started my job simply helping with data quality) however I don't claim to have any 'domain experience.'    Embed Quote
