★What joke requires the most pieces of domain knowledge to understand?
A mathematician, a statistician, a database administrator, and an astronomer were travelling north by train. They had just crossed the border into Scotland when the astronomer looked out of the window and saw a single black sheep in the middle of a field. "Interesting. All Scottish sheep are black," he remarked. "Not so fast," replied the statistician. "We'll need to see the others before we can make such a claim." The database administrator grew suspicious. "Is there just one, or are there many?  It looks to me like Scotland's only sheep is black." "Black on at least one side," said the mathematician.    Embed Quote
