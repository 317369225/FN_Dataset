★In what way can PICT Alumni come together,use their expertise,domain knowledge,strength and do something out of the world useful to the society?
I agree with Akash, there is a strong Alumni presence in PICT already. To do something "out of the world useful to society", it needs a 90% dedication from students and 10% from alumni. Right now we are missing the 90%. Students being new in the tech world are always going to need a little push, a little persuasion. I personally regret not being a part of any group today although I mocked a few members back in college. The students needs to realize how good these groups could be. Maybe what we need is more interaction between faculty and alumni. The day the faculty feels that an alumni group also makes a huge difference to students, that importance will automatically seep into the students too. That is one thing more that can be done but active student participation will always be more important than active alumni participation.    Embed Quote
