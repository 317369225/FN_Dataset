★How important is prior domain knowledge for success in developing a B2B software product for the enterprise market?
It's important to know, in that order: - what customers need? what are their problems you're trying to solve? - what are the technologies involved? - what is the ecosystem around that specific domain? For a non-technical founder, it is mandatory to keep these questions open all he time and accumulate knowledge and experience about them. Key is to master all the topics to be able to get the big picture allright. For deeper knowledge, you can rely on specialized co-founders or employees (technical people, bizdev people, aso.). You're not supposed to know everything.    Embed Quote
