★How important is prior domain knowledge for success in developing a B2B software product for the enterprise market?
What's more important than prior domain knowledge is the ability to understand the market, the (potential) customers, and their needs and challenges. There are many individuals and companies who have been able to do this well, despite having no prior domain expertise. In some cases, prior domain expertise is very important -- for example: scientific fields, highly complex technologies, anything highly-regulated. Prior domain experience is certainly very helpful, though if part of a team, each person need not be a domain expert. Often in start-ups, co-founders will bring different talents to the table, some with domain expertise, some technical expertise, and some with experience in developing and marketing successful products. There are plenty of situations where people with prior domain expertise have leveraged that knowledge and experience to recognize unmet needs in the market. Just the same, there are plenty of situations where people working in the domain are so stuck in their ways that they can't recognize their own problems or inefficiencies, and it takes an "outsider" to see the problems and solutions.    Embed Quote
