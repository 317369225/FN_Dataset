★How important is domain knowledge to data analytics?
Our previous number lookup service was reportedly identifying some T-Mobile subscribers as AT&T, who therefore could not complete transactions. A product manager switches HLR providers and wants to know if it helped. Pretty reasonable for a data analyst/scientist - I'd hope you could have an answer in well under an hour - "go!" You look at AT&T conversion before and after the change, and it looks a little better. But it clearly isn't statistically significant. Is that just noise? Who wants to waste an A/B test on something like this? Even if it improved, do you know why? Do you really want to just assume that the problem was fixed and potentially alienate a subset of your customers if you're wrong? What if you knew the specific place that an HLR error would show up - the SMS message containing the confirmation code wouldn't arrive if we had the network wrong, so instead of measuring conversion, you measure message delivery rates. Then you correlate that with overall conversion, and cross reference against message delivery rates on other networks. Finally, you inspect message delivery error codes to see if "subscriber unknown" or similar sounding errors were the cause of the decline in failures. Yup! That error code went away, message delivery went up, looks normal compared to other networks, and correlated well with the change in overall conversion. Good change, time to move on. Noticed another strange error while doing the analysis? Tell the product manager! The analysis isn't the hard part - SQL and Excel will be more than enough in this example. The hard part is knowing the right questions to ask, and that is what domain knowledge will get you.    Embed Quote
