★As part of an ERP software development team, what are the best sites to get domain knowledge on financials/accounting?I totally don't have any finance background.
Speak to the accountant, or else do a short accounting course. Maybe a six month intro. Way too often Developers learn financials from Business Analysts and Project leaders who have no idea about financials except for the accumulated knowledge they've gained on projects. Go to the source. Understand Debits and Credits, understand the difference between the Income statement and the balance sheet and know how a sub ledger feeds into a ledger. A lot of it is experience, but you must know the fundamentals    Embed Quote
