★In what way can PICT Alumni come together,use their expertise,domain knowledge,strength and do something out of the world useful to the society?
I believe the only thing that differentiates a great institute from ours is an active alumni association. IITs, IIMs have a very strong, closely knit community which takes care of it's young ones. Universities in the US get a fair share of their capital for research in the form of alumni donations and scholarship and support.  As a student, if an alumni motivates you to take up a field of study, you are more likely to develop interest in that field because you have a direct measure for calculating success in the domain. If the alumni works for an organisation and has the capability to offer placements, the motivational levels rise exponentially. For all this to work we need the Institute Management to make sincere efforts to develop a healthy alumni association. Its always a win win situation for both students and alumni and neither would like to miss the opportunity. I would go a step further in concluding that a dormant alumni association has only made matters worse. If children have to look for opportunities from outside the family, it is natural for them to have a disgruntled attitude towards the college. It is the duty of almuni to make sure their own kind are taken care of and it is the duty of the college to instill this value by providing all means necessary.    Embed Quote
