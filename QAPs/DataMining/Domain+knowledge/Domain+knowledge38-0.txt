★How many years does it take to have a full grasp of UX methodologies and domain knowledge?
It depends. You can get a decent understanding of the UX process by reading or attending a course but it's just theory until you put it into practice. And when you are actually working in UX, it will depend on the nature of the projects you're involved with, which is also influenced by the type of company that employs you and its industry. I've been in UX for about 5 years and there are certain methodologies I haven't had much exposure to, so while I'm considered a senior UX practitioner wherever I'm employed, there are gaps in my experience / things I don't feel confident in. I would also say that "domain knowledge" is more about getting to know the domain of your employer or clients. If you work in UX consulting or agency-side, you'll be getting exposure to a lot of different domains (although your understanding of it may not run deep, depending on the length of engagement).    Embed Quote
