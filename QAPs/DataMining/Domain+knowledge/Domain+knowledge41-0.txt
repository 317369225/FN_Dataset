★Is a small startup better off hiring a PR consultant with relevant domain knowledge or a general athlete?
A lot will depend on the startup's plan, but there are good reasons to consider a generalist for PR. One of the things that kills startups, for instance, is an inability to communicate the model or product to broader audiences. With a general practitioner, the company will have both a "reality check" and a translator for the wider public. Another advantage is that, given how often and how quickly nascent plans change in a startup, the specialty hired for today may not be applicable in six months. Put another way, as a startup's communications plan jells, dissolves and reforms, the company needs someone with a lot of flexibility and adaptability. Finally, there are degrees of specialization. A small startup might look for someone with general technology experience.    Embed Quote
