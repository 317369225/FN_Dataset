★When interviewing experienced candidates for quantitative positions at a hedge fund, should one ask brainteasers and math puzzles or focus on past experience and domain knowledge? Why?
I'm a quant with just short of five year of experience. And at least I'm expecting for my next job interview not to be about brain teasers and puzzles. That's just basically patronizing at this level of experience. Puzzles are good for entry level positions where you try and predict how fast the person is going to learn the job he knows roughly nothing about. But you should bee looking for someone who has done all that more than five years ago.    Embed Quote
