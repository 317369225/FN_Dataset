★How can one efficiently learn domain knowledge as a software engineer/IT consultant?
Usually, you don't ... instead, you team up with a strong "functional" manager with that domain knowledge and translate his/her vision into technical reality.  I have successfully done this several times.  Having said that, it is still prudent to learn everything you can about your domain - mostly by regularly reading the trade magazines that support that domain.  Additionally, talking to those strong "functional" domain managers every chance you get and pick their brains!  That is how I do it...  Best wishes!    Embed Quote
