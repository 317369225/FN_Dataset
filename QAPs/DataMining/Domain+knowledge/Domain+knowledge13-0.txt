★What are some good ways a programmer can build his/her domain knowledge to build better software?
Let's rephrase the question into "What are some good ways a programmer can become a better golfer?" Answers are: Watch the Golf Channel. Go to a driving range and hit balls. Play golf with an experienced player. Ask questions. Read the Golf Etiquette manual, to know the rules. Take a personalized golf lesson from a Pro. Most of all, play, play, play, play, and have fun. Now, substitute Golf with Finance, Biology, Insurance, or Logistics, and you get the idea. You have to learn the practice as if it is your main job. In Finance, for instance, that means start trading using your own money. Once you have a real stake in something, you will want to start learning about things much faster. Of course the 10,000 Hour Rule applies (Outliers (book) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia). Just don't take it too literal.    Embed Quote
