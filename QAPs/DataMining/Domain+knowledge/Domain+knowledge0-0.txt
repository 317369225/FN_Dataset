★What joke requires the most pieces of domain knowledge to understand?
Here's my favorite: Werner Heisenberg, Kurt Gödel and Noam Chomsky walk into a bar. As they get inside, Heisenberg looks around and then comments, "You know, there are three of us. And we're in a bar! This must be a joke! The question is, is it funny?" Gödel gives him a scornful look and says, "We can't tell whether it's funny or not: we're inside it." Chomsky chuckles and says, "Of course, it's funny. You're just telling it wrong!"    Embed Quote
