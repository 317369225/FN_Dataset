★What are some of the best tips for reading big code base when you have limited domain knowledge?Oh did I mention no documentation :) ... Tests are definitely the starting point, but what more can you do?
Try to understand the overall structure of the code without getting into details. See if some parts are not actually used. Try to understand the parts that are actually used. Apply the approach recursively (in a top-down way) until the structure gets complicated. Then figure out how the different components are related to each other. It may help to use automated tools for code analysis. If you can run the code and profile it, you will know where it spends most of the time and which functions were actually called. Some tools can build a coverage map - this can rule out code that was not used on given inputs.    Embed Quote
