★What are the best jobs for an electrical engineer?Or if you are a EE tell me about your experience
I'm an electrical engineer specializing in electrical power-basically, I build high voltage substations. The biggest advantage is that your job cannot be outsourced-people that design power systems/infrastructure  for industry and utilities have to be localized. It isn't practical to ship those jobs 3000+ miles away, the design process requires easy access to the job site itself. Another advantage is that there is a shortage of power engineers, because the majority of EE's don't think of power engineering as an option-they all want to work for Apple or Microsoft or Google, not the local utility. But utilities, consulting firms, manufacturers of high voltage power equipment, all need electrical engineers, and right now, there is a shortage of talent. The energy sector is one of the few sectors that is growing, and will grow as the power grids around the nation age further.    Embed Quote
