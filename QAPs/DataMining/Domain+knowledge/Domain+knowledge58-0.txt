★What are some of the ways using which a software engineer can increase her domain knowledge, esp. when she has never worked in that domain before?
You can take up online courses from websites like http://udacity.com or http://Coursera.org, I have taken some of these courses. They provide a lot of courses on various diverse domains, all of them are free and most of them do not require any previous knowledge of that domain or even programming! Taught by the best professors from the better universities on the planet and also entrepreneurs. These courses are really great and priceless! They give you quizzes and tasks to make if more understandable. Also there are forums where you can discuss your doubts or anything relevant/ sometimes even irrelevant. And if you complete a course successfully, you get a certificate of appreciation. hope it helps! :)    Embed Quote
