★How can machine learning techniques be combined with domain knowledge expressed in logical rules, semantic nets, etc.?
One way to do that is using Markov Logic Network. Markov logic network assigns weights to individual logical rules, makes use of markovian assumption and does a delayed normalization, resulting in a probablisitic distribution representation. It also supports probabilistic inference techniques like MCMC. Learning is assigning weights to these rules, which can be done using Maximum Likelihood estimation. Check Markov logic network for an introduction and Page on washington.edu for details. There is also a book on this subject: Introduction to Statistical Relational Learning    Embed Quote
