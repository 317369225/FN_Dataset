★How does one get the required domain knowledge when obtaining a degree in applied math or data science?For example, domain areas like Natural Language Processing, Bioinformatics, or Finance. Is it better to get a degree directly in that area? or to go for the broader Applied Math or Data Science program?
I think that domain knowledge is the most experiential and ever-changing fluid attribute in a data scientist'a toolkit. So formal education would be a sub-optimal way to acquire this skill set. This is because formal education, by definition, requires a formal process to update information content and delivery  If there wasn't a formal process, you and I wouldn't really trust it. This formality in the process makes content delivery time-consuming and inefficient. Contrast this with, say, your knowledge of vectorisation in R or ways to conduct stratified sampling - I'd say that these are relatively more stable (of course new packages keep coming up in software, new visualisation tools and so on). Such content is better suited to be delivered via formal education like a masters. For domain knowledge, I recommend reading up on latest research, following startups and larger companies doing cool work in your field, showing up at meetups and discussion groups and sharing knowledge there, and finally, buying practitioners in your field of interest for a cup of coffee and asking intelligent questions at that meeting (I imagine this is culturally contextual. Still I can't imagine who would turn down a well-intentioned invitation)! All the best.    Embed Quote
