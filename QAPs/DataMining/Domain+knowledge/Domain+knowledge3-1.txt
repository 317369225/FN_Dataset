★How much domain knowledge is useful for a software developer?
I don't think there is a simple answer. I am a generalist myself, because I haven't been able to keep being interested in one domain for too long. I think both types are needed, engineers with deep domain knowledge can solve specific problems, and generalists can cross-pollinate different industry domains.  The same goes for software engineering itself, for example, it's hard for a full stack developer to create a truly awesome UI and a well-designed scalable back end at the same time. I think you answered your question yourself, because in a well-balanced team there should be multiple types of engineers.    Embed Quote
