★How would you explain the difference between low coverage, high coverage, and exon targeted sequencing, to someone without expert domain knowledge?
Under the reasonable assumption that they know not all of DNA is translated, you can first distinguish the exome as the expressed part of the DNA only. Subsequently, low and high coverage can be referred to as low and high quality, but in the end it boils down to how much they want to know. Unless you really only have 30 seconds to explain it, I'd lean towards giving a simple explanation of how copies of DNA pieces are aligned, and then visually showing the read "layers" that create coverage. I don't think it's beyond someone who knows what DNA is already to grasp this concept.    Embed Quote
