★Could domain knowledge be used for deep learning tasks in order to get better performance?
A2A Sure. Neuroscience will deepen your understanding of neural net architecture; your deep learning application will be more likely to achieve business success if you are expert in commerce. Deep learning algorithms are theoretical, and domain knowledge are catalysts that help theory make real-world sense.    Embed Quote
