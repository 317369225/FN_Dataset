★What are the best jobs for an electrical engineer?Or if you are a EE tell me about your experience
"Best" is relative.   In my opinion the "best" job is the one you enjoy doing.  Which may not be the job with the best pay, or best security, or best $WHATEVER. I'm fond of ASIC design.  Analog and mixed signal jobs seem to be growing fast.  Those with MBA's in addition to EE's tend to make pretty good money, relatively speaking.    Embed Quote
