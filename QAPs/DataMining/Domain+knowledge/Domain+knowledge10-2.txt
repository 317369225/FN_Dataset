★How could Quora attract more doctors and medical students willing to share general domain knowledge (vs advising on specific patient cases)?
Comments above are a great start.   There have been many physicians and other health care professional early adopters who have been reasonably successful in navigating the intersection of health care and social media.  This is simply another tentacle or side street on this journey.   If you act and behave the way you would while discussing an issue with a colleague, idle passer-by, friend, etc--- and if you remain cognizant of --- and well versed in-- the over-lying privacy issues you *should* be fine.   That said... Associations should be offering actionable guidance.  They should be taking a much more active role in defining the playing field and wha the potential boundaries are.  Social media evolves far too rapidly for strict boundaries to exist.  Physicians and other providers should consider using disclaimers.  Keep your answers broad based and never communicate with a known patient in a forum like this.   There is so much that we as  physicians, nurses, therapists, and students can offer by being active on a site like Quora.    The more accurate, meaningful, and actionable content we can generate the better off all our potential patients will be.   We had a long discussion about this issue on FB recently  http://hjluks.posterous.com/face...  and a savvy health care attorney (healthblawg on Twitter) commented on my blog  http://hjluks.posterous.com/to-f...     about whether or not you should "friend" your patients in social media.  We are all patients... and one day a physician will look in a mirror and see a patient.  THAT patient will know how to navigate this horribly complex and inefficient system to their benefit.  Why not change the system so that it works the same way for everyone?   Content is a great place to start.    Embed Quote
