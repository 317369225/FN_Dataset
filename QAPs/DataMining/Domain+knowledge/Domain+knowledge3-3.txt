★How much domain knowledge is useful for a software developer?
You should have some basic knowledge and something/someone to consult. Really, forcing yourself to become an "expert" in a field which doesn't elicit passion in you is just going to torture you and focus you in the completely wrong directions. Do note that if the field does interest you, you should go the extra mile to be able to suggest more complete solutions yourself. Just keep a quick list of "what ifs" for the entire business process of your end product and ask yourself which codes are really worth exploring.    Embed Quote
