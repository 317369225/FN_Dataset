★For someone looking to learn about human biology without any pre-existing domain knowledge, what are the best books to read?Genetics, neuroscience, disease, etc
If you're looking for readable books, you can add the following to the above list; Gulp by Mary Roach The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer by Siddhartha Mukherjee. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot. If you want to get a true understanding of human biology you'll have to start the way all healthcare professionals do; using the building blocks of anatomy physiology and biochemistry to gain an overall understanding of how complex systems work. The works listed are all good reads, but it's hard for laypeople (even laypeople on Quora) to gain understanding beyond the superficial. Take an interest in something that affects you personally and go from there.    Embed Quote
