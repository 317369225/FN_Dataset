★In what way can PICT Alumni come together,use their expertise,domain knowledge,strength and do something out of the world useful to the society?
Not much that I am aware of. However, if they spend some more time talking to and sharing experience (academic, professional and personal) with current students right from FIRST YEAR onwards, they can surely help create a better crop of students. That would be direct impact on 1500 students. Basically prevent pictians from reinventing the proverbial wheel. That in my opinion would go a long way towards starting the cause that OP talks about.    Embed Quote
