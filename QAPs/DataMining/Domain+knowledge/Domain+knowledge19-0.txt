★When being considered for a grad school based on the application - is domain knowledge and understanding more important or hard skills?
There are two components to being considered for grad school --- admission (are you good enough) and financial aid (how will you be supported). Both aspects you listed are important, but the overall level, including hard skills, tends to be more important for admission. Of course, you need to have the knowledge in the general field of your target graduate program, and it particularly helps to have knowledge in the sub-fields that are strongly represented in the program (say, operating systems or machine learning). If you are applying for PhD (rather than MS), most universities will only admit you with financial aid. The most attractive type of aid is fellowship, and this goes back to "how good you are", so skills and overall performance (courses, standardized tests, letters) matter more than specific domain knowledge. To get a teaching assistantship (sometimes also available to MS students), communication skills are important, but also domain knowledge so that you can be assigned to a specific course. Research assistantships depend on the professor, but if you have domain knowledge that closely matches their ongoing project, that would be very attractive for both of you. I had such luck with an MS student in previous semester --- he had prior industry experience in exactly what I was looking for (he also had excellent hard skills though).    Embed Quote
