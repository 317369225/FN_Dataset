★How much domain knowledge is useful for a software developer?
Several years ago a domain expert friend of mine and I decided to start working on  computational logic software (mostly, but not entirely a first-order  automated theorem prover). He was an ABD PhD candidate in math at Arizona State… or maybe it was the University of Arizona, I can’t recall any more. When we set out I asked him if he thought I  could write the software  without understanding the  field. He said “no” and prescribed for me a course of study with him serving as a tutor of sorts. In retrospect, I have to agree. I doubt anything that complicated could be effectively programmed by someone lacking a pretty good understanding of the domain, at least the basics. For one thing, it takes a domain expert to be sure you're getting the correct answers!    Embed Quote
