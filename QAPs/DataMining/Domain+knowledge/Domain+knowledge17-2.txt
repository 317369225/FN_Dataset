★As part of an ERP software development team, what are the best sites to get domain knowledge on financials/accounting?I totally don't have any finance background.
I'm an ERP admin,and from a commerce/accounting background(12+yrs) and find the content on accountingcoach. Com very useful right from basics to trending concepts. In college we just used to refer our textbooks for passing exams but i found out that going back to them will help. Just do a read thru once. No need of doing the exercises. They are designed to teach students new concepts and people having experience will find the concepts easy to pick up    Embed Quote
