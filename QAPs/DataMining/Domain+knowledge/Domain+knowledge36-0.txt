★For someone looking to learn about human biology without any pre-existing domain knowledge, what are the best books to read?Genetics, neuroscience, disease, etc
Oh dear, what a broad question. I will throw out a few suggestions, but it really depends on what exactly you're trying to learn and how much basic biology you already know. If you are looking to gain technical knowledge, unfortunately textbooks and academic journals will be the most comprehensive sources. I really believe that everyone should have at the bare minimum one college-level biology course under their belt. The books listed here are more popular science reading that are interesting and don't assume a biology background. For learning and memory: Eric Kandel, In Search of MemoryFor neuropsychology, cognitive neuroscience VS Ramachandran, A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness; Phantoms in the Brain; The Man With the Phantom Twin Oliver Sacks, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat; An Anthropologist on Mars Eric LeDoux, The Emotional Brain That's what I can think of off the top of my head at the moment. Unfortunately a lot of the cool stuff in biology never get published for public consumption. Oh, I have to also recommend Time, Love, and Memory by Jonathan Weiner. It's a "history of science" book about the beginning-ish of genetics as a field of biological research. So. Good.    Embed Quote
