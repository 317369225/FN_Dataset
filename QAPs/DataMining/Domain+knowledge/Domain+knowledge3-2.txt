★How much domain knowledge is useful for a software developer?
It's useful for getting an interview. I've applied for dozens of jobs working in finance, and every one of those positions say that you have to have a background in finance.  The same thing for health care.  And military.  I didn't get interviews in the first two, but I got several for military because of my experience supporting the DoD.  During my time with the DoD I wouldn't have thought that I did anything different from a normal position. Now, that being said, you probably know more about accounting and how an online dating platform works than you think you do, you just see it from a different perspective than an accountant would, or from someone entering into ERP software for the first time. You've touched it, you know what's going on there and you could probably go on to support another ERP using that knowledge and experience. With my DoD experience I actually know a lot about the structure of the military, the government, how the budget works, how the software accreditation process works, how IA works in the government, how to navigate that domain generally.  These things don't float to the top of my mind when I think about what I've done with the DoD, which is administering servers and developing code to specifications. Also, I've noticed in applying for more jobs, domain specialization pays out much more than generalization, especially with regards to ERPs. So you've got that going for you,    Embed Quote
