★How important is it for an Enterprise Architect to have business domain knowledge?
It depends on a lot of factors. For starters, now and then you get to consult a one-off enterprise that nobody knows well - so you deliver through effectively engaging domain experts and abstracting their knowledge with their participation. Sometimes the client is catching up, and all they want is for someone to tell them how the industry leader[s] are doing that. Then it's specific business and application knowledge without any abstraction or discovery that will deliver what the client needs. Sometime the client is in an innovation drive, and nothing that is out there is good. Business knowledge could be beneficial, or could be obstructing the big picture, depends on how well you abstracted it and separated fundamental principle from some very specific and outdated decisions made in one particular place. Depends of how many times you asked "why?" so to speak. BTW, some people in that space have no business nor technical knowledge, they have a set of nice powerpoint and excel templates and produce nice reports and presentations that impress the ignorant but deliver no value. But that is another discussion. BTW Tom Deutsch, whatever the starting point was, by the time you talk to a Solution Architect of course you figured out what and why is important, that's the job.    Embed Quote
