★Is it posible to manage a team without domain knowledge?
Sure. Ask any CIO, CEO, or VP. Or  Steve Jobs when he was alive. Most senior managers have domain knowledge that is obsolete or so old that they could not return to being specialists (without some training). I just listened to a presentation that's a few years old where Craig Newmark - Craig's List - describes how he once coded but now does customer service because his coding is out-of-date and other people are better at it. However,  he's a fantastic manager (my opinion) because he has selected the right people for their jobs and understands his product and his customers. Manage the outcome through the activities, not by performing the activities. Often, strong technical experts let their knowledge get in the way of good PM. While it's helpful to have domain knowledge, experts tend to want to jump into the execution rather than the management. However, in order to get respect, you need to bring some domain knowledge of PM. Learn PM and get your team to understand the value of collaboration, buy-in, communication and PM methodology. Use tested management and communication strategies to monitor/track the project and to engage with your team members. Involve the team in all stages of PM: initiation, planning, execution, monitoring/controlling, and closing. Also, a good book to read (besides PMBOK) if you don't have supervisory authority over your team is "Results without Authority..." by Tom Kendrick. Good luck.
