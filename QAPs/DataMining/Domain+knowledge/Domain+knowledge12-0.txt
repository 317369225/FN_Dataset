★Could domain knowledge be used for deep learning tasks in order to get better performance?
Yes it is still useful for feature vectorization. For example in images, moving window and rotation of subsets of images is always going to give more robust performance. Word embedding techniques still benefit from stop word featurization. Removing irrelevant part of speech tags for topic modeling is good. TFIDF based bag of words approaches are good for feeding in to a neural net. Sound will always benefit from a smoothing of the signal. It really depends on the domain though.    Embed Quote
