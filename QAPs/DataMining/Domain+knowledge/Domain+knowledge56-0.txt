★How would you explain the difference between low coverage, high coverage, and exon targeted sequencing, to someone without expert domain knowledge?
I've always explained coverage like so: We have machines the sequence DNA, and we know that they make errors now and again. If we sequenced any piece of DNA once, we'd suspect that there's probably mistakes in ther, but we wouldn't know where. We work around the problem by doing the sequencing more than once -- we look at how many times we get the same answer for a particular part of the sequence, and the more often it's the same, the mor confidence we have in the result.    Embed Quote
