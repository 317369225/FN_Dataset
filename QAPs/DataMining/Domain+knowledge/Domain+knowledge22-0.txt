★How can a new entrepreneur gain the best domain knowledge on a specific topic?Is the internet the main place to research or should you be out there having real interactions. If the latter whats the best way to gain access to real world knowledge?
Both. You should read everything you possibly can about your domain and put out Google Alerts on your competitors. Read blogs of industry leaders and make sure you know it in and out. You need to know the terminology, trends, etc. But in order to get the product right, you need to talk to people. Customers, people in that industry, etc. If you haven't worked in a specific field before you're going to have no idea who actually makes the decisions, what motivates them, etc. For example, if you're selling a tool to car manufacturers, you need to talk to them to figure out how exactly the purchasing is done, when, why, etc. If you're selling something to consumers, you need to know what demographics are going to be interested in your product, what motivates them, etc. in the same way. Even with consumer products, it's not always the end-user who makes the purchasing decision or funds it. I would say if you're in the initial exploration of your idea, spend about 25% of your time reading and researching and 75% of your time talking to people. Also, try to have conversations with the people writing whatever it is you're reading online. They could be very helpful to you.    Embed Quote
