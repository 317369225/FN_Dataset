★I am a software engineer, a technical guy and I am interested in learning functional concepts in finance. What is a list of courses/certification which would add value to my CV as well as give me good exposure to finance domain knowledge?
Pretty tough question or better to say aspiration, to shift from a technical perspective to finance functional. Do you completely want to switch over or want to remain in technical sector having functional domain knowledge in finance ? Then I would say you may want to go for SAP Finance module or Tally ERP course certification to gain good functional understanding of finance domain.    Embed Quote
