★In what way can PICT Alumni come together,use their expertise,domain knowledge,strength and do something out of the world useful to the society?
Short Answer: This already happens. Long Answer: Let me start with some examples where this already happens. ColloQuium (CQ): An informal technical group whose motto is Learn, Share, Innovate, already conducts weekly (well, monthly now) tech sessions for current students. This is basically a "By the students, For the students" initiative. Dreamz, PICT Linux User Group (PLUG): Alumni Groups who provide BE project guidance. Art Circle: Cultural Group which concentrates on working and helping everybody with their creativity. Perhaps the best example of unity. Circle of Knowledge (COK): A public group to provide an interactive platform for knowledge  sharing among students in the computing field. PICT Pune Tech Group (PPG): A Facebook based tech forum / group where talks about technology flow like water. And there could be many more that I'm unaware of. I could very well talk a lot more about ColloQuium, Dreamz, PPG since I am a member of these groups. The problem lies in the college environment. We really can't expect each and everyone student to be a part of these groups. Not all students are keen about learning Tech (even though they've taken up a college like ours) Perhaps what we (as alumni) really need to think about is how can we promote these groups more and more. That's it. And what students really need to do is "my answer to What courses/things/topics/activities A student of Computer Science in PICT, Pune should attend/have/do to have a advantage in future life?"    Embed Quote
