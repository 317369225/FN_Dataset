★Why do business plans require a 3–5 year revenue forecast if everyone knows that these forecasts are never correct?Creating a 3 or 5-year forecast of how the money is going to be made is like predicting the weather for that same period - it is simply impossible. I've heard it said that investors want to see "the quality of the thinking" behind it. Isn't there a better way to prove that we are smart, than by spending time on a forecast that has no basis in reality?
In my mind, the point of a 3-5 year plan is that it shows that you've thought through how this business could grow (market/revenue/products/services) and how the costs would scale as you do that to show how good a business you would have.  Nobody believes that the numbers are perfectly accurate, but a thought-through plan: Gives people a starting point in understanding how your business could evolve over time Shows them how much you have thought through Is a first look at how the business model works and how profitable this type of business could be Shows an assessment of the market for what you're doing vs. competition, etc... Shows how the costs scale at volume Is a starting point for them to ask questions so they can gauge how well you really have thought this through and how likely you're anywhere close to correctWithout such a plan, both you and the potential investors have to start from scratch on every engagement for them to understand your opportunity. In reality, a brand new startup business isn't run from a 3-5 plan.  You get some initial capital, you set some short term goals for what you want to achieve with that capital and you go from there, regularly adapting your plan as new information is available.    Embed Quote
