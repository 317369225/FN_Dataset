★Are machine learning algorithms used in weather forecasting?If so, which ones? If not, why? It seems like a very good application for machine learning.
I think in general, weather forecasting is a problem where there is a well-developed underlying theory based on physics, so that is the starting point for models in the field.  A commonly used model is the WRF model for example ( http://www.wrf-model.org/index.php) which is used by the National Weather Service and other public and private applications.  This model has an important component called Data assimilation, where model forecasts are reconciled with real observations.  The approach used in that part of weather forecasting is in many ways similar to machine learning and many techniques can be transferable (and probably are by some research groups).    Embed Quote
