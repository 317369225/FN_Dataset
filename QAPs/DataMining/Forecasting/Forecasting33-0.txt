★Must a Scrum team stick with the Sprint commitment or is it just a forecast?Given  the fact that there is a Sprint Goal defined by the end of the Sprint  Planning session, must the stories-commitment of a Scrum team be hold,  even if the team has to do a lot of extra hours? The effect of working  extra hours would motivate teams in doing more 'realistic' estimation of  stories and better knowing about the team velocity.
The latest Scrum Guides (see - Scrum.org - The home of Scrum) describe the stories accepted in a sprint as a forecast. The team should try and complete the work but in general not work overtime to do so. I think the overtime is more likely to get an unrealistic estimate as the team under commits to avoid working the extra hours.   Also by having the team work extra hours you are circumventing 2 benefits of scrum.   1.      Surfacing of problems: The fact the team did not meet their commitment means there is a problem somewhere. It could be any number of things. The team could have simply over estimated how much work they could do but it could also be because the test environment is unstable or the story needed major clarification or some other factor outside the team’s direct control. By working extra hours you are hiding the problem rather than addressing it. In the long term addressing the problem will increase the amount of work the team can produce.   2.      Sustainable Pace: Having the team work overtime every few weeks is likely to have negative consequences over the long term such as high turnover rate, burn out and disenfranchisement.   The best way to handle this is to let the team fail to meet the sprint commitment, discuss why this occurred in the retrospective and then address the problem in the next sprint.    Embed Quote
