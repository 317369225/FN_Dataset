★Are Deep Belief Networks useful for Time Series Forecasting?Nearly every example I have seen involving deep belief networks involves some sort of facial or image recognition problem.  Is there any particular reason why these new techniques aren't being applied to time series forecasting (perhaps they are but are not being published)?  I'd really like to see how one could configure a Neural Network in Matlab that takes advantage of some of these new methods.
Here is another paper on top of Yoshua Bengion's suggestion for time series modelling using deep learning- Page on stanford.edu    Embed Quote
