★What are the best demand forecasting models?
This is not so much a demand model as an actual sales model, but how about the following, that takes a very mechanistic approach and ties to demand generation levers. 7 inputs: #1: Adoption curve (how quickly your product/service is expected to penetrate its target market). For breakthrough innovations creating a market, you may want to assume an S curve, where adoption rate starts slow, then accelerates, then decelerates.  For incremental innovations coming to an existing established market, people assume an inverted J curve, where the rate of adoption decreases over time.  What matters here is to understand the shape of your curve, not the actual coefficients. #2-5:  assumptions that have to do with your product and how you will bring it to market: ProductxPricexPlacementxPromotion #2 Product:  look at your product (or service).  Look at alternatives (solutions to the user need).  Find the next best alternative.  Rank your product vs. that next best alternative. How much would you sell vs. the next best alternative if you were competing in the same channel?  That's your product assumption.  If you plan a drastic improvement at a given time, you can evolve that #3 Price:  what is the change in demand you would expect from a change in price.  Do you expect to evolve price over time?  plug that in #4 Placement: where is you product going to be available?  How will that evolve over time?  What is the relative strength of a new placement? #5 Promotion:  what is your promotion budget?  how will you spend it?  What CPA are you expecting? #6 Seasonality.  Seasonality is the change in demand from one time period to the next.  The great news is that seasonality does not vary that much from one product to the next for a given use case, so it is usually easy to find comps. Google trends is a good tool for that #7 One time events (mostly competitors moves)    Embed Quote
