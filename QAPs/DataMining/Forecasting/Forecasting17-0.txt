★Where is the best place to learn time series forecasting?
Rob Hyndman, author of the R forecast package CRAN - Package forecast, has an online book that is an excellent place to begin: Forecasting: principles and practice. Read through his blog, it is also fantastic. Here are my go-to time series resources: Welcome to a Little Book of R for Time Series! http://robjhyndman.com/publicati...
