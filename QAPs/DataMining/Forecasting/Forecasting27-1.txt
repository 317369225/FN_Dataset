★What is the best way to do revenue forecasting for a startup?
Roll a dice... (just kidding) Startup revenue forecasts -- unless you already have a good pipeline of customers and a shipping product -- tend to be constructed fairly arbitrarily (pulled out of a hat, or elsewhere, as the investors sometimes say). However, if you do have customers, a known pipeline of sales, or data on acquisition rates and uptake of your product, you might have better success at forecasts.    Embed Quote
