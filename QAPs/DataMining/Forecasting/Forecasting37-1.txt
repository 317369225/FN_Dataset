★Is there a model that Product managers can use to forecast how a feature will  impact KPIs?
For starters you need to know what the KPIs are. Assuming that's the case, you should think about drawing a line in the sand on how you think a new feature will impact them -- start by picking one KPI. Let's say you're trying to increase the % of Daily Use and you add Feature X, which you think will do that. It's a fairly simple hypothesis: Feature X will increase % of Daily Use. But the line in the sand means you should pick a target that you want to improve the % Daily Use by. So for example, you might say: Feature X will increase % Daily Use by 10%. Now you have a line in the sand that you can measure progress against. Picking that line in the sand isn't easy, but it's important. It's a "line in the sand" and not "set in stone" because if you miss the target you don't give up, but you can genuinely look at the results and have a productive conversation about whether you're headed in the right direction or not (and/or if the feature is doing what you wanted.) When picking a line in the sand, there are a few things you can throw into the mix: * Any historical data you have on previous features added and their impact; * Be audacious but not insane; * Tie the line in the sand to a bigger model of progress (i.e. if you increase daily use by 10% how does that impact your overall biz models and financial models?) * Find benchmarks amongst other similar companies The line in the sand is an educated guess. It's easy not to do, but try setting those goals and then you have something to focus on vs. trying to decide after looking at the results if you were successful or not.    Embed Quote
