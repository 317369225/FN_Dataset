★Must a Scrum team stick with the Sprint commitment or is it just a forecast?Given  the fact that there is a Sprint Goal defined by the end of the Sprint  Planning session, must the stories-commitment of a Scrum team be hold,  even if the team has to do a lot of extra hours? The effect of working  extra hours would motivate teams in doing more 'realistic' estimation of  stories and better knowing about the team velocity.
How much does the goal matter? Most of the other answers here align around the ideas of the team learning and improving. Which are good. But... If we change the lens slightly and ask, "What happens if we fail?" what answer do we get then?    Embed Quote
