★Who forecasts the weather?Weather forecasts are everywhere--from weather-specific websites to my local TV station. But who creates all those forecasts? Is everyone just re-packaging the same forecasts (from, say, the National Weather Service)? Or do they do they do their own, independent forecasting?
Most stations get a feed from NOAA, NWS or Accuweather. However some larger stations add in their own data (Doppler, spotter data, historical data) to formulate a clearer understanding. The majority of weather data is free to have/use from NOAA but it's raw data and not very pretty. If you have a little satellite hardware (small dish, etc..) you can pick up weather feeds from various satellites that broadcast as they pass over. It's similar in a way to how ESPN gathers sports data, add in their proprietary portion and publishes the result for others to broadcast.    Embed Quote
