★What is the difference between budgeting and forecasting?In a large organization who calculates each and how? I look at the monthly reports sent out by the company and the budget and forecast never match. Why?
Think of these as a timeline. You start with a "budget" (plan), then continue to "forecast" until an "actual" result is known. |--Budget------Forecast------Actual--| So, forecasting is what happens after the budget is set, but before you know the actual results. In a way, forecasting is like a continuously revised budget for the remaining portion of the year ("continuous" typically being monthly, right after the books are closed and you can look back at actuals to see where things have been trending). Once time passes, you know the result and that is your "actual". Things change throughout the year, so forecasting helps a business adapt and reallocate resources as new information becomes available, or new events take shape. However, it's still important feedback for the business to see what the budget (often called "plan") was at the start, so the budgeting process can improve for the next year (or however long the budget cycle is).    Embed Quote
