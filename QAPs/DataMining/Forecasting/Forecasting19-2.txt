★What are the fundamental equations used in weather forecasting?
Unless you're intending to embark on an extremely long, involved and expensive project, I'd recommend using the outputs of existing numerical models (i.e. GFS, NAMM), just as professional forecasters do, rather than attempting to construct your own. Different professional forecasters mostly all refer to the same small handful of models, but make different decisions regarding, for example, which model to trust in a given situation. Becoming a good forecaster is matter of gaining practice and skill interpreting model outputs. [I participated in MIT's forecasting team during my freshman year].    Embed Quote
