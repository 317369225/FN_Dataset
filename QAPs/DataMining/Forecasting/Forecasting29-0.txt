Consulting Support: Defined number of hours to support workforce planning initiative. The methodology that we use is 1.  We understand the Supply Forecast for a given scenario based on various parameters such as Retirement, voluntary attrition, hiring, inter-function movements etc. 2. We then understand the Demand Forecast based on parameters such as Revenue Growth, manager ratios, scalability, etc. 3. We do a Gap analysis on basis of which we help taking people actions such as Optimal Hiring , Internal Movement , Skill Development , Key Development , Globalization , Alternate Labor Supply etc. We have just launched a free ROI modeler for Workforce Planning which could be downloaded at Workforce Planning Tool Kit Visit our site or write to us at info@talentneuron.com for more information.    Embed Quote
