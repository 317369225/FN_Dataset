★How reliable is the Elliot wave analysis in forecasting the markets?
The issue with assessing Elliot Wave's ability to forecast the market has to do with the difficulty in creating a quantitative system around Elliot Wave.  The technique, as practiced by most people, is highly subjective - what one person marks as a A-B-C wave can be substantially different from what another person marks.  As a result, it is very challenging to put a quantitative measure on top of the analysis. I have read some studies that attempt to quantify the technique - automating the selection of the different waves based on certain criteria.  None of the studies, to the best of my knowledge, have shown any quantitative benefit from the approach.    Embed Quote
