★What is the difference between budgeting and forecasting?In a large organization who calculates each and how? I look at the monthly reports sent out by the company and the budget and forecast never match. Why?
In lot of ways, one needs to forecast to budget! Budgeting is a typical exercise to plan for the next financial year. While budgeting you need to forecast revenues and expenses in the next financial year and plan accordingly. If looked at each of them independently, Budgeting is a process which is typically done prior to ending of current financial year for the next financial year, while forecasting is an ongoing process and goes on throughout the year.    Embed Quote
