★What website has the most accurate weather forecasts?
I think Neil Gordon's answer sums things up very well. But I will add that people often don't realise that many weather websites contain forecasts that have not had any input by professional meteorologists, and consist only of automatic output from a computer model. Often the computer models used have not been developed for the location in question, for example a model from the US may be used to generate automatic weather forecasts for locations in Australia, without taking into account local effects. In contrast, meteorologists will examine a number of computer models, as well as numerous observations from weather stations, satellites and other sources, and will draw on their own knowledge about local effects when generating weather forecasts. It's also important to realise that weather forecasts become less and less accurate as you try to forecast further and further ahead. At the moment, forecasts are usually given up to about 7 days ahead, as it's generally not possible to give useful information much further out than this. There are websites around that give forecasts out to 2 weeks or more, but the accuracy of such long range forecasts is likely to be very low. As Neil mentions, your best bet is to look for a website that is provided by the national meteorological service of whichever country you are in.    Embed Quote
