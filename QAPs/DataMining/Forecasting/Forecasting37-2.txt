★Is there a model that Product managers can use to forecast how a feature will  impact KPIs?
For me, I use base reporting tools at my disposal: Google Analytics, revenue tracking (internal), click tracking (media), respective App Store dashboards (downloads/updates) and timestamps when new code is deployed to production. I take all of this and drop into Google Docs to measure what new features (and what old ones were killed in latest release) impacted base reports. Revenue is a pretty clear function of this as well as responsiveness for clicks. From there, the data is then manipulated for what we expect growth is like against what we've previously released. It's close but not 100% accurate.    Embed Quote
