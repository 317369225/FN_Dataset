★Where can web startups learn about financial modeling that accounts for the important metrics and costs?
I try and cover modeling and metric topics regularly on my blog. In addition, there are some good learning events particularly the one by founder institute that cover this. Dan Martell and Dave McClure used to run finance for founders which sounded very interesting. Ultimately, you can only learn this by doing it: get an advisor, mentor, investor and build a model together. Have them teach you how to fish. As our portfolio grows at Real Ventures, I will be doing group sessions on this and 1 on 1 modeling.    Embed Quote
