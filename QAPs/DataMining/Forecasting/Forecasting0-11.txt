★Where can web startups learn about financial modeling that accounts for the important metrics and costs?
I won't go through the nuts and bolts of building a complete financial model comprised of all financial statements, as that's beyond the scope of a pre-money web startup. I'd build a DCF model based on projections of user base growth and per-user engagement / revenue growth. For user base growth, I'd try to estimate virality, the spread on paid advertising campaigns, and organic growth (I have built a virality model here: http://ufert.se/user-acquisition...). For per-user engagement and revenue growth, I'd estimate how the development of new products and features will increase the LCV of users over time. Then factor in fixed and variable costs to come to some sort of a projection of income over the next 3-5 years.    Embed Quote
