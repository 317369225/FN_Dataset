★How reliable is the Elliot wave analysis in forecasting the markets?
I agree with Damian and Jascha in that the accuracy/predicitive value in technical analysis greatly hinges on the quality of each individual's analysis, and the subsequent interpretation of the data.   I would add that several traders I interact with use Elliot Wave more as a confirmation in their overall trend analysis, rather than the typical forecasting metric more commonly used when interpreting Elliot Wave. Since there is a large amount of subjectivitity in technical analysis (and not to mention that it is not rare for indicators to contradict one another at certain points in the market cycle), many traders can/do use Elliot Wave as more of a "road map" of where we might be in the trend. This is a backward looking, or lagging, analysis of EW, but nonetheless helps in confirming one's overall analysis.    Embed Quote
