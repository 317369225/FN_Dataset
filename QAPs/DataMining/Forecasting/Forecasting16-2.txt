★What website has the most accurate weather forecasts?
In the US, you can check forecast advisor for rankings of which services are most accurate for your location. http://www.forecastadvisor.com/ I just typed in Atlanta (where I live) and got this for the top ten list for last month: The Weather Channel  80.95% Weather Underground  80.28% WeatherBug  77.01% CustomWeather  73.89% MeteoGroup  72.78% AccuWeather  72.50% National Weather Service  72.50% Foreca  71.94% Dark Sky (forecast.io)  71.67% Persistence  47.50% The forecasts from The Weather Company, which owns both The Weather Channel and Weather Underground, tend to be more accurate for most locations.  I work there, so of course I'm biased, but this is an independent site so you can check for yourself. Here's what they say about how they calculate accuracy, by the way; The overall accuracy percent is computed from the one- to three-day out accuracy percentages for high temperature, low temperature, icon forecast precipitation (both rain and snow), and text forecast precipitation (both rain and snow). Temperature accuracy is the percentage of forecasts within three degrees. Precipitation accuracy is the percentage of correct forecasts. The forecasts are collected in the evening.    Embed Quote
