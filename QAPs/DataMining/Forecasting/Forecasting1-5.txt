★Why do statisticians study forecasting techniques when most forecasts turn out 'wrong'?
Because you are looking at the wrong forecasts. Statistical models deal with "known unknowns". Interesting examples in real life deal with "unknown unknowns". For example, some of the people forecasting the swine flu epidemic in the UK a couple of years back had an unusual problem - their estimates were too good. How can an estimate be too good? Well, their model assumed nothing changed. During the summer, that was a fair assumption. Once school was back in session though, and once the football season started, there would be a lot more disease interactions. So their margin of error was too tight, and they knew that their confidence intervals didn't reflect the true uncertainty in the process. Allowing enough flexibility in your model to deal with real world uncertainty is tough. So, statisticians study forecasting techniques that give good forecasts of predictable things (like election results using polling data from the week leading up to the election), but the techniques aren't so good at forecasting unpredictable things (like election results two years from now). Also, you'd be surprised how many forecasts turn out right. We just don't hear so much about them.    Embed Quote
