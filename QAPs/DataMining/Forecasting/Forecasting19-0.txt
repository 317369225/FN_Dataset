★What are the fundamental equations used in weather forecasting?
Here is a concise summary of the governing equations used in synoptic-scale dynamical meteorology. In particular, the horizontal momentum, thermodynamic, incompressible mass continuity, and vertical momentum equations in isobaric coordinates, and the water conservation equations are given. The horizontal momentum equation is applied to the dynamics of a straight jet, though this is treated in more depth in other parts of the web page. This discussion is organized along the following topics: 1. Begin here 2. Background 3. Horizontal Momentum Equation 4. Alternative Momentum Equation 5. Interpretations 6. Application of Horizontal Momentum Equation to Straight Jet Streak Dynamics 7. Mass Continuity Equation 8. Thermodynamic Equation 9. Derivation of Thermodynamic Equation: Part I 10. Derivation of Thermodynamic Equation: Part II 11. Hydrostatic Vertical Momentum Equation 12. Water Conservation Equations 13. Simple Water Process Diagram That was easy, got any more questions.

If you just want to do your own forecasting WXSIM Weather Simulator which is apparently a home grown weather simulation system seems like a way to begin. http://www-history.mcs.st-andrew... is a useful article with a good discussion of the methods for actually computing the model that uses these equations.  I was hoping there would be a difference equation equivalent to the partial differential equations that are given above.  I found none, however the suggestion that Fourier transforms make computation simpler appears to be an avenue to pursue.  With the FFT method, there may well be a way to conduct meaningful computation without the need for supercomputers.    Embed Quote
