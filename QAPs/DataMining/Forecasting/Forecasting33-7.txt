★Must a Scrum team stick with the Sprint commitment or is it just a forecast?Given  the fact that there is a Sprint Goal defined by the end of the Sprint  Planning session, must the stories-commitment of a Scrum team be hold,  even if the team has to do a lot of extra hours? The effect of working  extra hours would motivate teams in doing more 'realistic' estimation of  stories and better knowing about the team velocity.
No. As Luke points out the notion of a 'commitment' has changed in the Scrum Guides. This been one thing that the Scrum founders wished they had phrased differently using a term like 'forecast'. Many times the team fails to deliver what it forecast for reasons beyond their control such as sickness, interruptions etc. Requiring the teams to work overtime in such situations is a huge de-motivator. It will likely lead to things like 'agile sucks' because in traditional techniques they could likely make up the time later in the schedule. A team retrospective will help determine the reasons for delivering less than anticipated. And this should be done in a no-blame way by focusing on the facts and being open and respectful.    Embed Quote
