Nate Silver's book "The Signal & the noise - Why so many predictions fail but some don't" is an awesome read. He gives us the real examples from sports, politics, weather etc. and explains the reasons. While reading the book, one realizes that some of the reasons are so obvious but we just don't pay much attention.    Embed Quote
