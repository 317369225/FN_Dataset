★How can big data be applied to economic forecasting?
Read the article "The Data Revolution and Economic Analysis" (available at Page on stanford.edu ) which discusses how new data may impact the economic policy and economic research. Large- scale administrative data sets and proprietary private sector data can greatly improve the way we measure, track, and describe economic activity. The paper also discusses that whether the big data predictive modeling tools that have emerged in statistics and computer science may prove useful in economics. I hope this paper will answer most of the query raised in this question.    Embed Quote
