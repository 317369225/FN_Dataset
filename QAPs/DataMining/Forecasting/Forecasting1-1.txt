★Why do statisticians study forecasting techniques when most forecasts turn out 'wrong'?
"All models are wrong, but some are useful" -George Box [1] Although models will not completely explain the underlying behavior of say, the stock market, people's purchasing decisions, or the intent of someone's search query, the model helps us better understand these complex phenomena and predict how they might behave in the future. These predictions won't always be correct, but they'll be simpler and more accurate than speculating or just looking at loads of raw data. [1] George E. P. Box    Embed Quote
