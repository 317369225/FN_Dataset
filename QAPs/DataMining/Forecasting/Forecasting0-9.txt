★Where can web startups learn about financial modeling that accounts for the important metrics and costs?
I recently went through a crash course in financial modeling.  No expert advice here, but some simple lessons learned as a non-MBA entrepreneur.  The best place for learning is inside your own spreadsheets, imo. 1) Find a basic model to use as your starting point.  I got lucky with this, but if you know someone with a failed business you could ask them for their old financial spreadsheets. 2) Dive in.  You will need many many hours to give this model a shape that resembles reality, so find your most productive times of day and don't break the focus. 3) The advice of someone knowledgable is huge, as you will need someone challenging your assumptions and providing you with some benchmark business costs along the way (some of this can also be found online - this post is pretty great http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007...). Other people have spoke about the levers that drive your business and it's very true, as you'll be able to answer questions like "what happens if we aren't converting sales at the rate we expected?" versus "how valuable is decreasing our churn rate by x%?"  And, you'll also be able to approximate what your business looks like in a couple years, and which acquisition channels will likely bring you the most revenue. Above all, the projections forced me to challenge the validity of my starting assumptions, mining whatever data I had and putting together a more realistic picture of what our growth and optimization looks like.    Embed Quote
