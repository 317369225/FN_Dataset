★What's a good wind forecast app for Android?Specifically for Kitesurfing
I really think you should be focussing on the quality of the forecast rather than the mode of delivery. Ie  use your browser if necessary. For New York, I've seen that NOAA forecasts are actually very good. They get the fewest number of false negatives and false positives. And the best part is that its free. Iwindsurf.com is another site I used to use but I found them to be unreliable. I realised I used to pay for them because I thought more money meant better accuracy but its also not true. But of course with forecasting something as random as the weather you really cant say. Windguru.com is antoher one that I trust more than iwindsurf.com . Again its free for Great South Bay  (NY) where I used to mostly kiteboard. The best forecasts are usually from a local kiteshop owner who you trust. These guys know the seasonal variations and understand the local weather. Or you could join the local ktieboarding mailing list/message board. You can bet when the weather is about to get good that the mailing list will get busy. NYCkitesurfers on yahoo groups is a great group if your in NYC. Another strategy is to look at 3-4 different forecasts and then take what the majority is saying. All said and done you have to trust something :). If your in NYC then trust NOAA, windguru and get on the NYCKitesurfers mailing list. I think right now thats the optimal solution.    Embed Quote
