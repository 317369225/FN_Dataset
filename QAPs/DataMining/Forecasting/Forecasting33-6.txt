★Must a Scrum team stick with the Sprint commitment or is it just a forecast?Given  the fact that there is a Sprint Goal defined by the end of the Sprint  Planning session, must the stories-commitment of a Scrum team be hold,  even if the team has to do a lot of extra hours? The effect of working  extra hours would motivate teams in doing more 'realistic' estimation of  stories and better knowing about the team velocity.
My Scrum team originally did commitments (many years ago). It always annoyed me.  Somewhere along the way I asked in a retrospective where we had "pulled in" a small story or two, I commented how it was funny that when we came up short we had to put on a hair shirt and flog ourselves in the retro, but when we delivered more than planned, there was no ticker-tape parade.  I therefore called BS on "commitment", and the team basically agreed.  We stopped committing as of that Sprint.  I only found out later that the concept commitment had been dropped, or adjusted in meaning, by the Scrum community. The thing is, a properly-formed team is almost always implicitly committed.  Generally, good teams perform well because they like to perform well.  The chief motivator is being rock stars. Count yourself lucky if you can form such a team.    Embed Quote
