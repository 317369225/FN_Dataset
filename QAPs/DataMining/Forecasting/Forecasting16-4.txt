★What website has the most accurate weather forecasts?
Search for a NOAA National Weather Service City forecast offices "Area Forecast Discussion."  These discussions are technical but readable for the informed individual. This is the most updated (3-4 times a day) regional discussions obtained from numerical forecast models interpreted by an actual on-duty forecaster. Interestingly enough you will find most TV weathermen get their info right off these same sites while often pretending they figured it out themselves.    Embed Quote
