★Are there people who forecasted the 2000 or 2008/09 crises?I am not talking about people who are always bearish, but i am talking about people like Mark Cuban ( he was maybe just lucky, or he predicted it ), or people who are portrayed in movie called Margin Call.
The best list of people who can reasonably be said to have predicted the 2008/9 crisis rather than just "getting lucky" was put together by Dirk Bezemer in his paper, "No one saw this coming": Understanding Financial Crisis Through Accounting Models which I recommend that you read. Table 1 in that document summarises the list. In order to get on that list economists needed to get the timing approximately right and needed to base their prediction on some sort of model, theoretical or empirical.    Embed Quote
