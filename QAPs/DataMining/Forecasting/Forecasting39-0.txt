★How can you forecast or estimate sales on the app market?Is there some model utilizing publicly available data (such as # of reviews) that can help us model an apps sales numbers?
At Distimo we have data of over 9000 developers that gives us enough data to model statistically the download figures, however, this service is not yet available (soon to come). Our tool, Distimo Monitor (free, http://monitor.distimo.com/ ) gives you insight into the performance based on the rankings (you can add competitors and see their rankings since January 2010). As the rankings are primarily based on downloads you can extract valuable information for your analysis. I have answered some questions before on quora, you might have a look at: - How many App Store downloads are there for the top 25 Paid apps in each category? - What's the number of app sales required to enter the Top 10 or Top 25 on the App Store in each category and country?    Embed Quote
