★Why do business plans require a 3–5 year revenue forecast if everyone knows that these forecasts are never correct?Creating a 3 or 5-year forecast of how the money is going to be made is like predicting the weather for that same period - it is simply impossible. I've heard it said that investors want to see "the quality of the thinking" behind it. Isn't there a better way to prove that we are smart, than by spending time on a forecast that has no basis in reality?
Rather than the actual revenue forecast, it is the identification of factors impacting the revenues and quantifying the impact which is the real objective behind the business plan. The process leading to a 3-5 year forecast should be a continuous process every startup should continue post funding as well. Properly done the process helps in identifying the various factors, risks etc impacting the business. It also helps you point out if any of your assumptions / thinking behind how you expect the business to grow, is totally incorrect, by comparison with revenue / financial data from similar companies. For e.g. if I am planning to target 10 customers every quarter, I can put in this figure, success rate % etc assumptions in the revenue (or user base in case I am not expecting revenues in the beginning) model to actually identify how many customers I should actually target.    Embed Quote
