★What are the best demand forecasting models?
It's difficult to say what's the best model. But in most cases a simple model works better than really complex ones, in my experience simple exponential smoothing based have worked reasonably well.  For e.g when I worked on forecasting models for airlines, we used a combination of exponential smoothing and kalman filter based models. Another thing to keep in mind is if your time series data has variable prices, in which case it is best to try forecasting at a mean or expected price and then adding an additional component based on price variability. Simple regression based techniques can give you a decent estimate of the price elasticity.    Embed Quote
