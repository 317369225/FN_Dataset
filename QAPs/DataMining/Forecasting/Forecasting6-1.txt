★How reliable is the Elliot wave analysis in forecasting the markets?
Several answers highlight the weakness of standard Elliott Wave theory, which is that it is highly subjective in terms of understanding two things: identifying exact points when a trend reversal has occurred and should be labelled, and understanding the magnitude of the wave identified in terms of the fractal subdivisions of waves. There is a sub discipline of general Elliott Wave theory called Objective Elliott Wave, OEW, which claims to have overcome these challenges. The methods used by the OEW group were developed by Tony Caldaro and are proprietary. As an active member of the OEW group, I can say that the objective methods they use are robust. But, this in itself does not mean that the future can be projected perfectly. As Elliott Waves progress many "alternative counts" become apparent that may suggest different Market outcomes, each which may legally develop according to the labelling rules.    Embed Quote
