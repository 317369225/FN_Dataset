★Why do statisticians study forecasting techniques when most forecasts turn out 'wrong'?
All wrongs are not equal. Some models are less wrong than others. Asimov had a word or two to say about this in his essay: The Relativity of Wrong. In case you dont have the patience for the whole essay I would say read the excerpt below: "When people thought the earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together."    Embed Quote
