★What's a good wind forecast app for Android?Specifically for Kitesurfing
I've been kitesurfing for about 7 years of and on. For forecasts... the key is to get as many different ones for the same location as you can, if they all agree you can be fairly confident. If not, be more wary. It's also useful if the location you are concerned with has a weather station that reports wind, or at least one nearby, then you can see how well the forecasts you have are doing, if they are correctly predicting the wind now, you can be more confident on their predictions for later on. My favorite app for android is the windfinder app.    Embed Quote
