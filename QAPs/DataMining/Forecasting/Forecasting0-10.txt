★Where can web startups learn about financial modeling that accounts for the important metrics and costs?
I would highly recommend Startup Financial Model! This is the best tool I ever found on internet. I am recommending it to all my friends entrepreneurs. I used to work on a project and we hired PWC, it cost us almost $40,000 to build custom financial model for our project. I was pretty impressed when one VC referred me to Startup Financial Model, it's a great tool and its basically free.    Embed Quote
