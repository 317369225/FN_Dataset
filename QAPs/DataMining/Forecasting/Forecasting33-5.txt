★Must a Scrum team stick with the Sprint commitment or is it just a forecast?Given  the fact that there is a Sprint Goal defined by the end of the Sprint  Planning session, must the stories-commitment of a Scrum team be hold,  even if the team has to do a lot of extra hours? The effect of working  extra hours would motivate teams in doing more 'realistic' estimation of  stories and better knowing about the team velocity.
I disagree with the effects that you mention of working extra hours. Pressure by doing overtime doesn't motivate a team, nor does it help them to estimate better or get more insight into their velocity. What I've seen working are teams that failed to deliver, and then did a proper retrospective to understand what happened to learn from it. Even better would be that when a team recognizes that it can't meet the commitment during the sprint, it does a quick investigation to see if they can change their way of working during the sprint to solve it, and if so takes action. Work smarter, not longer! @BenLinders    Embed Quote
