★What great forecasts have become true?I mean those who were able to predict an event or a trend with good accuracy; but not those who repeat everyday that tomorrow will rain, finally it will rain one day.
The reality is that all forecasts seem to come true.  The trick is to predict something specific but be vague on when it would occur.  Or be specific about the timing and vague on specifics.  The other trick is to offer two opposites - this will be certain to happen unless that occurs.  And repeat the same in a reverse way.   Bingo!  When either happens you've suddenly become a predictor of great things!  This technique seems to be very common with people in the stock and commodities market! I won't bore you with specifics but there are too many examples of this.    Embed Quote
