★What is the market size for online recruitment/job postings? What is the forecast?
I read somewhere LinkedIn believes its addressable market is $25B which I would guess is also the market you are talking about, although it does have some additional services compared to job boards. update- I've also heard $8B for US sourcing software exclusively - i.e.not including ATS, HR, etc.    Embed Quote
