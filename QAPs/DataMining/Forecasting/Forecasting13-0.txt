★What are ways to do Attrition Forecasting?For an industry such as IT services, attrition is a commonality. I am looking if there are anyways to forecast the attrition. Any models, templates will help?
The best way to forecast this will be off of prior data. Look for some kind of ratio comparing # of customers lost per month vs. the # of customers you started with. You can also look at # of customers lost vs. revenue, and then break it out by revenue brackets. So maybe you have an average attrition rate of 10% for your lowest revenue bracket, 5% for your mid revenue bracket, and 2% for your highest revenue bracket. Once you have this data, you can enter it into your sales forecast and see how it will affect your numbers going forward.    Embed Quote
