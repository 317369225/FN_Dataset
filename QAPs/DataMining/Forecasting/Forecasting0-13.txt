★Where can web startups learn about financial modeling that accounts for the important metrics and costs?
Like Anonymous, I too found the Startup Financial Model by accident and have been very pleasantly surprised. We needed a tool that would allow us to model our projections in a way that investors require and this saved me spending countless hours building it myself or spending countless other hours repurposing an existing inadequate model. Also, founder Wade Myers was incredibly responsive when I had questions. The cost ($40) is meaningless when compared to the opportunity cost of building this model myself from scratch--time that will be better spent acquiring customers for our startup.    Embed Quote
