★What is the best way to do revenue forecasting for a startup?
The best thing you can do it be honest with yourself. Don't create a forecast that hits $XXX million just because you think that's what a potential investor wants to hear. You need to be confident that your plan of action and business model are realistic and achievable. Check out http://60mo.com for a non-excel method of creating your plan, with built in standard reports and integrations to accounting tools like QuickBooks. Just remember, it doesn't have to be right, just realistic.    Embed Quote
