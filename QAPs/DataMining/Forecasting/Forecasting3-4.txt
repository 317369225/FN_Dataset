★What is the difference between budgeting and forecasting?In a large organization who calculates each and how? I look at the monthly reports sent out by the company and the budget and forecast never match. Why?
Usually a Budget is a plan for how much you will spend.  It is in a sense a forecast, but as you control it it is a pretty reliable one. Usually when people say "Forecast" they are adding in both the budget and predictions about what will result from spending the budget and other resources like time and facilities.  In short, a budget is a spending forecast, forecast usually includes other predictions. --------------- Greg http://www.finansavvy.com    Embed Quote
