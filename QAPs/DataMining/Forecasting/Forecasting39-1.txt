★How can you forecast or estimate sales on the app market?Is there some model utilizing publicly available data (such as # of reviews) that can help us model an apps sales numbers?
AppAnnie (http://www.appannie.com/) is probably the only company that has enough data and has a statistical model around it to predict download numbers in specific categories and ranges. Xyologic is way off. For all our apps it's at least 100% off. I would recommend AppMonsta (http://appmonsta.com/) to get raw data about store ranks, movement and some more algorithmic analysis of public available data. Based on their data you can run your own estimates. We're using AppMonsta for different things at our company.    Embed Quote
