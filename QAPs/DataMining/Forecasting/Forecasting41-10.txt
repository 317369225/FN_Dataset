★What is the best free online wind forecasting resource for North America?Looking for an equivalent to http://www.xcweather.co.uk/, which is awesome for the UK.  Ideal website would have good forecasting 6-7 days out and forecats by hour.
We have just updated our mobile BlooSee app, including free worldwide wind forecast. You can zoom into any particular region of the world, and have a 24-hour forecast there, every 6 hours. Or watch the big systems evolve on the global world map. Displayed data comes from NOAA, and the bandwidth is minimized as the information is sent compressed and the iPhone/iPad does the graphic rendering. More info here: www.bloosee.com/mobile The app includes other features, such as charts, points of interests and a nav station, but the wind forecast alone makes it a good resource. We'll include other forecasts in the future (swell, temp, etc.)    Embed Quote
