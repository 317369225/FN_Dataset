★Where can web startups learn about financial modeling that accounts for the important metrics and costs?
One thing i'd like to point out as a sub-topic within financial modeling are growth predictions. Growth forecasts seem to involve quite some guess work, especially for early-stage startups it would be very interesting to know the growth curve of companies within a certain industry. Big consultancy firms have departments that create growth models for the growth forecasts needed by M&A advisors. I wonder how startups can do this? Maybe if the community would share such data, or extract such data from some source ourself. Does anyone know any places online where you can find historical growth data?    Embed Quote
