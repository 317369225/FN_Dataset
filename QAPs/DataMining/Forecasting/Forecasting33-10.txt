★Must a Scrum team stick with the Sprint commitment or is it just a forecast?Given  the fact that there is a Sprint Goal defined by the end of the Sprint  Planning session, must the stories-commitment of a Scrum team be hold,  even if the team has to do a lot of extra hours? The effect of working  extra hours would motivate teams in doing more 'realistic' estimation of  stories and better knowing about the team velocity.
Scrum calls for both a forecast of what the team believes it can achieve, plus a shared commitment to work together toward the sprint goal. Any team that decides on its own to work extra hours is fundamentally different from any team that "has to". Teams that strive for more "realistic" estimation tend to pad estimates so as to never challenge themselves. Relative estimation and empirical planning tend to eliminate such nonsense.    Embed Quote
