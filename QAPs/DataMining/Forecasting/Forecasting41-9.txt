★What is the best free online wind forecasting resource for North America?Looking for an equivalent to http://www.xcweather.co.uk/, which is awesome for the UK.  Ideal website would have good forecasting 6-7 days out and forecats by hour.
Another good free source in addition to those mentioned is www.usairnet.com.  They give aviation specific forecasts, show winds aloft.  There are a lot of good maps and information available.    Embed Quote
