★Why do business plans require a 3–5 year revenue forecast if everyone knows that these forecasts are never correct?Creating a 3 or 5-year forecast of how the money is going to be made is like predicting the weather for that same period - it is simply impossible. I've heard it said that investors want to see "the quality of the thinking" behind it. Isn't there a better way to prove that we are smart, than by spending time on a forecast that has no basis in reality?
It's like any entrance exam: those who do not pass it would fail if allowed to continue, but passing it is not a guarantee of success. On the plus side, coming up with plausible figures for growth, profits, staffing, market share etc. for a few years into the future does prove you have thought deeply about your business idea. On the minus side, in my experience at least, people who ask for business plans place much too much reliance on tables of numbers and not nearly enough on intuitive understanding of the fundamentals of success like problem solution fit, value proposition, differentiators or switching costs.    Embed Quote
