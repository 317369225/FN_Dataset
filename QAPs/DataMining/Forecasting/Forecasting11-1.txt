★What is the revenue forecast(s) for the "gamification" market?
It's a good question - and is hard for a new market. Typically when market sizing you (a) try to find a good comp (b) try to do a top-down model or (c) try to do a bottom-up model. For (a) - what's a good comp for the gamification market? It's like web analytics meets loyalty meets marketing. So do you use Omniture, Epsilon or WPP? For (b) you need a market to start with ("all the people in China") that you then start paring down ("and 50% have bicycles"). So the same question arises - what market do you start with? For (c) you'd start with all the potential customers that could use gamification. So you'd say for instance there are X sites with 1 Million or more monthly Unique Visitors, and that's my potential customer base. 50% of those are porn, so what's left is .5X. I'll get Y% market penetration and they'll spend an average of $Z and so I'll make $SOME_BIG_NUMBER. So now the question is - who are the potential customers? We've tried them all and are pretty comfortable about where we've ended up, but it's been a non-trivial exercise. This turned out to be a very long answer that didn't actually answer the question. The shorter answer is that we don't disclose that information, but at least you can see how we might get to reasonable numbers.    Embed Quote
