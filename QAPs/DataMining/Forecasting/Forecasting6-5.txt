★How reliable is the Elliot wave analysis in forecasting the markets?
I think it is much more reliable in theory than in reality. Being that much depends on subjectivity. So would depend on whom is doing the analysis to determine how reliable it is. It's hard to be consistent on where the wave starts and stops making it something in need of constant revision.  Just as with technical analysis it is a mixed bag. By definition it is somewhat of a Catch-22. If everyone used the method then the very patterns and most forms of technical analysis would be rendered useless. Perhaps with new(er) Internet and social media driven data could breath new life into the method using the "crowd psychology" more accessible and via data-mining techniques.    Embed Quote
