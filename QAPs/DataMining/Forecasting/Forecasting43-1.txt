It seemed everyone had a mobile phone in the future, even if they thought computers should have flashing lights. http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hidden-P... this book in 1957 predicted that one day people would wear brands and be proud of them He also went on to predict fan-boys, people who would be fanatically loyal to people who sold them things and wait for launches.
