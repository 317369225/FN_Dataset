★Where can web startups learn about financial modeling that accounts for the important metrics and costs?
In addition to Matthew Carroll's awesome answer.  I would also add in a sensitivity analysis. Such as what does your LTV of each customer or what happens to time you hit Break Even if: your product gets delayed by x months sales is down 20% from forecast avg sales commission drops by x% sales conversion raises or drops by x% viral k factor at different rates comparing debt, and looking at growth and return on invested capital The idea is to get a better idea of what things might look like if different external factors were to occur.  And sensitivity analysis helps you respond appropriately if some one were to be really critical of your financial forecasts (like investors).
