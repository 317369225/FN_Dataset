★What are the best demand forecasting models?
It depend on the characteristics of your demand.  Seasonal or cyclical demand calls for completely different models than flat demand items.  This is why it is better to get a forecasting program that does a "best fit" (or for you old timers "focus forecasting").  Most forecasting tools offer this and these range from desktop to enterprise integrated packages - John Galt, and Demand Solutions are two that I have worked with and can recommend. I do have to add that any forecast tool will be wrong and wrong quite often.  The past just doesn't always repeat itself reliably.  That is why many of us try to get people away from forecasting (and MRP) by implementing Lean.  As a shameless plug, the book 'Lean Supply Chain Management Essentials: A Framework for Materials Managers', (as well as many other Lean books) shows you how to do this.    Embed Quote
