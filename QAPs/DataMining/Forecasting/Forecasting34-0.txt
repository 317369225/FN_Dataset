★Are there people who forecasted the 2000 or 2008/09 crises?I am not talking about people who are always bearish, but i am talking about people like Mark Cuban ( he was maybe just lucky, or he predicted it ), or people who are portrayed in movie called Margin Call.
For sure -- in fact, if there weren't any people like that, it would be a really strange statistical anomaly.  For example, there are certainly at least 1,024 people in the world who make a living by predicting markets.  To simplify what they do, say that they flip coins once a year.  Then, you would expect one person to be right every year from 2005 until 2014, including 2008.  Now, if you add on the millions of people who may not make public predictions but do so indirectly via their market positions, such as the fund managers that Eric Kolovson mentions who do it at scale, you'd get a lot of very lucky forecasters.    Embed Quote
