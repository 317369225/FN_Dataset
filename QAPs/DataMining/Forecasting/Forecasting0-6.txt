★Where can web startups learn about financial modeling that accounts for the important metrics and costs?
Find someone that does them and learn from them -- an entrepreneurial CFO, for example.  The models aren't as complicated as they appear on the surface, but trying to go through one without context and discussion is likely to miss a lot of the point. Some of the key things we identify are: 1) Unit economics.  What drives your revenue?  What adoption do you anticipate?  Attrition?  How much revenue does each user represent (ARPU)?  2) Cost of revenue.  Transaction fees, licensing fees, other acquisition fees etc. are all considered.  You need to know that if you generate $10 of revenue it took $n to generate it. 3) Operating expenses.  These are hopefully fixed costs and can include everything from office expenses to cloud costs. 4) Capital expenditures.  Most web startups are light(er) on capex, but you're still likely to have some.  You need to understand these. From this, typically you'll create projections of cash flow so you know where you stand, how much capital you need, etc. This is all at a very high level of course.  So really, your best bet is to sit down with someone and work thorugh a few examples of your own if you can. *Disclaimer: I'm not a finance guy, though I've had the luxury of working with great finance people.    Embed Quote
