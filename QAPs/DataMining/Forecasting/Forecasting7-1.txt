★What are the best demand forecasting models?
The best comparison of pure time-series forecasting models is the M-competition (initiated by Spyros Makridakis at INSEAD). You can find the results from one of these competitions here: http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/r.... Usually, some form of exponential smoothing comes out on top. The method is simple, and really versatile. It captures the basic trade-off in time series - what variation represents noise, what variation represents change, really well.
