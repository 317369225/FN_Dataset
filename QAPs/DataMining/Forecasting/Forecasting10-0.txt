★Is technical analysis reliable for forecasting future prices?
Stock prices do follow some mathematical tendencies. Fibonacci retracement, for example, is a thing that you'll often see occurring in real world stocks. But then pine cones and pineapples also display fibonaccical properties. So is it a reliable predictor? No, not at all. Beyond mathematics frequently describing the tendencies of markets, there lies the "dark arts" of technical analysis where people use the human eye to spot things like head and shoulders, double tops, flags, blah, blah, etc. Humans are great at spotting patterns, and given random noise will often find patterns that don't really exist - the face on mars, for example, or people looking at clouds, or the odd things mariners see out at sea. People using TA on charts are making use of that skill to find patterns that may or may not exist. Is it reliable? No. The benefit in TA, or anything else for that matter, is that it's systematic and so removes emotion from buy/sell decisions. Human psychology works against the investor  (we should buy when things are going to hell in a handbasket, but our little voice tells us not to), and systematic tools help overcome that. But are they reliable? No. Are they worth learning about? Yes! Remember, if anyone really had all the answers they'd be the richest person in the world just from trading stocks. If you must listen to anyone, listen to Warren Buffet rather than the guy with the slick patter and a big mortgage  trying to sell you an expensive TA course.    Embed Quote
