★Must a Scrum team stick with the Sprint commitment or is it just a forecast?Given  the fact that there is a Sprint Goal defined by the end of the Sprint  Planning session, must the stories-commitment of a Scrum team be hold,  even if the team has to do a lot of extra hours? The effect of working  extra hours would motivate teams in doing more 'realistic' estimation of  stories and better knowing about the team velocity.
A sprint commitment is just that - a commitment to get a set amount of work done in a set amount of time; if your team can't achieve their goals, then they need to adjust the type and amount of work that they are committing to.    Embed Quote
