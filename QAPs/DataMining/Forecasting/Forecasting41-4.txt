★What is the best free online wind forecasting resource for North America?Looking for an equivalent to http://www.xcweather.co.uk/, which is awesome for the UK.  Ideal website would have good forecasting 6-7 days out and forecats by hour.
I am a big fan of http://www.windfinder.com/ especially for mobile devices. They will add a point forecast for any site in the world.    Embed Quote
