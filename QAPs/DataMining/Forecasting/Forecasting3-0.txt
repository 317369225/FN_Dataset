★What is the difference between budgeting and forecasting?In a large organization who calculates each and how? I look at the monthly reports sent out by the company and the budget and forecast never match. Why?
You have good reason to be confused. A lot of people use these terms interchangeably. Sales forecast and sales budget are often the same thing. So are expense budget and expense forecast. For some, the budget is what the company and its finance management is allowing, or suggesting, in advance, managers can spend. The forecast is what the company's planning department is guessing will happen. For some, the budget is what we allow for spending and the forecast is what we expect will actually happen. In my years running a company I never budgeted up to the limits implied by the forecast, because I wanted to hold spending to a comfortable maximum and then hope things went better and we could afford more. If you watch over time, you'll find that people tend to associate forecast more with revenue generation, as in sales; and budget more with expense management, as in spending budgets. Conclusion: a lot of business terms acquire their meaning inside the company culture. Definitions tend to become single-company-centric.    Embed Quote
