★What is the state of the art in prediction and forecasting technology?
This area is a good example of a disastrous disconnect between scientists and business practitioners. The first often know How, but not Why and What. The second - could really benefit from the knowledge of the first group, but have no visibility or imagination to even consider the possibility. In rare occurrences of successful immersion, the results are often deemed to be too valuable to market, so they rather use it for their own benefit and keep it a secret. Very interesting field.    Embed Quote
