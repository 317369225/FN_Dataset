★What is the revenue forecast(s) for the "gamification" market?
There should be numerous benefits to bringing game-like behavior to a variety of applications and destinations, and numerous techniques (virtual goods, viral growth, etc.) that should be able to add directly to the bottom line when they're used, but I don't think that gamification is a market in and of itself (like Core, Social, or Casual). It's a bit like asking about the revenue forecasts for graphic design, or database development. You can use the techniques that Rajat outlined to determine potential benefits on a case by case basis, but there's no single answer.    Embed Quote
