★What is it like to work at Stratfor (Strategic Forecasting)?
I was with Stratfor from its founding -- staff meetings in the pool -- to year 2000. I worked directly for George Friedman most of that time. George was a great and demanding mentor, and is one of the most brilliant people I've ever met. In short, it was a fascinating place. We worked on a lot of very interesting projects for a wide range of clients -- most were happy with the results. In my time there, Stratfor worked entirely in public data -- so the implication that the work was "illegal" or involved "surveillance" was something that I personally did not see or experience. I think the nature of Stratfor's business and the fact that they're a private company makes people suspicious.    Embed Quote
