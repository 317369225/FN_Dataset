★Must a Scrum team stick with the Sprint commitment or is it just a forecast?Given  the fact that there is a Sprint Goal defined by the end of the Sprint  Planning session, must the stories-commitment of a Scrum team be hold,  even if the team has to do a lot of extra hours? The effect of working  extra hours would motivate teams in doing more 'realistic' estimation of  stories and better knowing about the team velocity.
There is no "commitment" in Scrum. Read carefully Scrum Guide - there is only "forecast" mentioned everywhere. Even grep for "commitnment" and there is no results. It looks like a very small difference, but it has been main change in one of the Scrum Guide releases (AFAIR in 2011). Words which we are using builds our perception and reality. In last Scrum Guide version from August 2013 Sprint Goal is crucial for Scurm Team. Of course if team didn't met the Sprint Goal that means that there are probably some problems. "The effect of working  extra hours would motivate teams in doing more 'realistic' estimation of  stories and better knowing about the team velocity." No it won't. It will demotivate them. There are always high expectation from business. "Commitment" has been one of the tools which has been used by business and managers, who has been looking for opportunity to use "stick" ("sticks and carrots" method). Look at "The Team" as their are people not just another Scrum artifact. Motivation is something more complex than that. After few failures like that team-members will probably say that "Scrum sucks". This is one of the reasons why "commitment" has been removed from Scrum few years ago. There is assumption that people always do the best what they can, and work the best as they can. Working overtime leads to frustration and demotivates people, as Luke said. Sustainable pace and realistic goals is all what you need.    Embed Quote
