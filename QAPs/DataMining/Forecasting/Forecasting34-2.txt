★Are there people who forecasted the 2000 or 2008/09 crises?I am not talking about people who are always bearish, but i am talking about people like Mark Cuban ( he was maybe just lucky, or he predicted it ), or people who are portrayed in movie called Margin Call.
Of course.  There are people who have predicted a meltdown in every year since 1933.  People who chronically predict disasters are like broken clocks they are bound to tell the right time every now and again.    Embed Quote
