★Is there online accountancy software that does cashflow forecasting?Ideally it would have lots of functionality, be saas and be nicely usable
Give our product [http://60mo.com] a try. While we're not "true" accounting (with payroll, depreciation, taxes, etc.) we do provide great analysis of past income / expense, and even better forecasting capabilities. We integrate with QuickBooks and QuickBooks Online (and other accounting tools soon), so you can get the best of both worlds for cheap.    Embed Quote
