★How reliable is the Elliot wave analysis in forecasting the markets?
Elliot wave analysis is popular, which is why I think it could be powerful. Look, like many of the other posters here, I also believe that fundamental analysis trumps all. It is far more effective to know the 'story' than to draw lines on graph. However, the more people use a particular system, the more you can exploit it. For example, thinking about how traders are likely to pin strikes on their options positions and gamma hedge around it (i.e. knowing what the "key levels" are) could potentially help your execution.  As such, I wouldn't be totally dismissive of Elliot Waves or other forms of technical analysis.    Embed Quote
