★Are Deep Belief Networks useful for Time Series Forecasting?Nearly every example I have seen involving deep belief networks involves some sort of facial or image recognition problem.  Is there any particular reason why these new techniques aren't being applied to time series forecasting (perhaps they are but are not being published)?  I'd really like to see how one could configure a Neural Network in Matlab that takes advantage of some of these new methods.
Deep learning is indeed used for modeling sequences. There are many good papers on the subject. You might want to look up the work of my PhD student Nicolas Boulanger-Lewandowski, for example: Nicolas Boulanger-Lewandowski.    Embed Quote
