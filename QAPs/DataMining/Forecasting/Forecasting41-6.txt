★What is the best free online wind forecasting resource for North America?Looking for an equivalent to http://www.xcweather.co.uk/, which is awesome for the UK.  Ideal website would have good forecasting 6-7 days out and forecats by hour.
http://www.sailflow.com/ generally has reliable current information and forecast wind predictions with pressure and direction.  You can pay for the service but basic information as well as direction and pressure changes and buoy information are also available.  I also use WindFinder, but haven't found that to work as well.  iPhone app is handy though.    Embed Quote
