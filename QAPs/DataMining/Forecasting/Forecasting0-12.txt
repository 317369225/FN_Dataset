★Where can web startups learn about financial modeling that accounts for the important metrics and costs?
If you are in the New York area, I'd highly recommend Taylor Davidson's Skillshare class: http://www.skillshare.com/classe... If you're not near the NY area, check out his website, he is a great resource and I learned a lot from him: http://taylordavidson.com He has a newsletter and templates you can use to "tell a story with math," which I think is a great way to look at an otherwise mundane topic. He's worked with a ton of startups doing this very thing and he's really good at what he does.    Embed Quote
