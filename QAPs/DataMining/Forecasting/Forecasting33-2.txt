★Must a Scrum team stick with the Sprint commitment or is it just a forecast?Given  the fact that there is a Sprint Goal defined by the end of the Sprint  Planning session, must the stories-commitment of a Scrum team be hold,  even if the team has to do a lot of extra hours? The effect of working  extra hours would motivate teams in doing more 'realistic' estimation of  stories and better knowing about the team velocity.
Experiment. Do what works best for you.   We used to say that the sprint goal was a commitment. To meet the commitment the team would rush around at the end to get things done. Testing became a bottle neck and developers would sacrifice weekends and quality to get things done. The team would also showcase stuff that was still in development leading to false expectations of progress.  And they started under committing in sprint planning.   So in summary insisting the teams forecast was a commitment led to a lot of bad waterfall like behaviours and outcomes. It really turned each sprint into a short waterfall release. From what I've heard most people experience these problems when they use this approach.   Now we use Scrum and Kanban and say that velocity is just a forecast. We only showcase stuff that is really truly finished. If stuff is nearly finished at the end of a sprint we don't rush to complete it we just move it to the next sprint and finish it on day one or two.   Our aim is to make the workflow smooth and continuous because this allows people to work much more efficiently and effectively. We find it works much better. Try it and see.    Embed Quote
