★Are there people who forecasted the 2000 or 2008/09 crises?I am not talking about people who are always bearish, but i am talking about people like Mark Cuban ( he was maybe just lucky, or he predicted it ), or people who are portrayed in movie called Margin Call.
One good place to start, if you're interested in traders, is to look at the funds that made money during these crises. As an example, here is a New York Times article listing the major money managers that did well during the 2008 crash: The New York Times. Of course this is an imprecise way of measuring who predicted the crisis. Some of the people on the list might have gotten lucky and some people not on the list (who did predict the crisis) might have gotten unlucky. But it's a good place to start. And there are a couple folks on the list who were pretty vocal about predicting some sort of debt-driven crisis, or at least crash. Also there's one guy on this list who seems to make money no matter what happens.    Embed Quote
