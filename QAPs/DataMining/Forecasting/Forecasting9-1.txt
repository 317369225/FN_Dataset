★Who forecasts the weather?Weather forecasts are everywhere--from weather-specific websites to my local TV station. But who creates all those forecasts? Is everyone just re-packaging the same forecasts (from, say, the National Weather Service)? Or do they do they do their own, independent forecasting?
There are actually private weather forcasting coimpanies such as Intellicast, etc. which are not connected with the National Weather Service. Also, there are colleges which have weather data collecting capability and use that to forecast and of course hobbiests like me with a home weather station and who sometimes forecast to anticipate severe weather for doing photography or video.    Embed Quote
