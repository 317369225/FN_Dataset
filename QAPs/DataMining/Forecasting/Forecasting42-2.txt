★Why do business plans require a 3–5 year revenue forecast if everyone knows that these forecasts are never correct?Creating a 3 or 5-year forecast of how the money is going to be made is like predicting the weather for that same period - it is simply impossible. I've heard it said that investors want to see "the quality of the thinking" behind it. Isn't there a better way to prove that we are smart, than by spending time on a forecast that has no basis in reality?
It totally depends on the field of activity. I suppose you meant experimental startups? It is hard to write a BP for such s startup, but nevertheless it is really important. You mentioned 'quality of thinking', this is exactly the point. The ones reading your BP don't know you, they don't know your skills, they might know nothing at all about you. So they need a starting point and a BP is a good starting point to see if the candidate shows good reasoning or is a 'dreamer'. Personally you also benefit from the process of making a BP. By being forced of thinking everything through X times, it helps you to find holes or hidden problems. You will be smarter after writing the BP than you were before 'hopefully', if not rewrite it ! ;)    Embed Quote
