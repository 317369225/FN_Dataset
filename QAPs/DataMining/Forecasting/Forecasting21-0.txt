★What is it like to work at Stratfor (Strategic Forecasting)?
Without any inside information, I am pretty sure that people at Stratfor don't see their work through the prism you describe, so it is probably pretty much like any consulting desk job, where people are cranking out reports (in this case, on geopolitics), hustling clients, and trying to upsell value added-services.  The leaked documents make it clear that there is a strong streak of name-dropping, which is a bit unusual, but not very (think William Morris, ICM) and a strong streak of commercialism, which is not at all unusual.    Embed Quote
