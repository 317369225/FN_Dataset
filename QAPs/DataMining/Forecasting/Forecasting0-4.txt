★Where can web startups learn about financial modeling that accounts for the important metrics and costs?
I highly recommend Startup Models (www.startupmodels.com).  Delivered as an Excel workbook, it is available for free from the website above and is very self-explanatory.  An optional companion ebook is available online from the website as well. The automated model will take you through setting up the basic variables, setup costs, recurring and non-recurring revenues and expenses, employee and contractor costs, other standard and non-standard revenues and expenses.    Embed Quote
