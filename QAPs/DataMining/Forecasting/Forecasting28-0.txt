★What is the difference between prediction and forecasting?
IMHO prediction is based on disjointed pieces of facts which may or may not influence the outcome being defined as prediction. A forecast is more organic extension of the counted facts that could be traced backwards and forwards to determine the outcome. Simply put, I would assume a forecast to follow a model or a formula. Whereas a prediction could be anything for a 'finger in the air' comment to a calculated forecast (again with no precedence).    Embed Quote
