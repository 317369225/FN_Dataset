★What website has the most accurate weather forecasts?
We recently launched www.weatherist.com.  We track local and national forecasters for your city and grade them for accuracy.  We also generate "The Most Probable Forecast" which is a mashup forecast based on those accuracy grades - think of it as a daily weather fantasy team.    Embed Quote
