★Must a Scrum team stick with the Sprint commitment or is it just a forecast?Given  the fact that there is a Sprint Goal defined by the end of the Sprint  Planning session, must the stories-commitment of a Scrum team be hold,  even if the team has to do a lot of extra hours? The effect of working  extra hours would motivate teams in doing more 'realistic' estimation of  stories and better knowing about the team velocity.
Forcing a team to complete all stories from the sprint backlog is highly counterproductive. Agile is about measuring the velocity of a team, not pushing a team to certain limits. Once you measure velocity, you can start learning, remove impediments, lift bottlenecks,... It's about establishing a relationship of trust and communication between the team and the product owner (and stakeholders). Forcing developers to work extra hours is exactly one of the reasons why waterfall isn't working :)    Embed Quote
