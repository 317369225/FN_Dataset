★What is the revenue forecast(s) for the "gamification" market?
I appreciate the quotation marks, because I share Ian Bogost's misgivings @Gamification is Bullshit about the name. But naming aside, the way I look at it is to consider one sizeable subset of the potential market: job training.  I've seen several estimates for worldwide annual job training, from about 500 Billion to 2 Trillion dollars - and of course that's ALL types of training.  But if you peg it at a mere 1 Trillion, and presume that in say, 10 years that 5% of all job training involves game-based learning or some aspect of game play, you get $50 Billion, or on the rough order of the size of the entire video game industry today.  That's just one very rough estimate based on my personal views, but I have found it persuasive.    Embed Quote
