★What are some best practices for inventory forecasting?
I'd maybe add a note of caution to Dimitris answer, which is that statistical forecasting techniques, although a really good starting point, often don't provide very accurate forecasts when they are left to their own devices. There are plenty of things that an algorithm simply cannot know (e.g. you're going to discontinue product X or you're planning promotion Y). So if you are looking for an inventory forecasting tool, it might be worth considering a tool that let's you add your business acumen to the statistical forecasts that it generates before you use those forecasts to go ordering 30 boxes of a products that you're about to discontinue. In short, unless you have a really stable product line, you probably don't want a tool that operates on auto-pilot. Conversely, trying to do everything by hand quickly gets overwhelming - so definitely look for a software product to help you do this. After that, there are a whole bunch of different forecasting processes that can be adopted (consensus forecasting etc.). Try to choose one that won't be too time consuming since the most important thing about any forecasting process is that it should be reviewed fairly regularly. Reviewing forecasts 2-3 weeks into the selling season and adjusting them to take account of actual (current) sales data is going to do more for your forecasting accuracy than any of the latest and greatest algorithms will.    Embed Quote
