Question with assumptions:  Why do Jews and Muslims hate each other?
Jews and Muslims do not have any reason to hate each other, which is precisely why many of them don't. Israelites and Ishmaelites have a pretty sizable pool of reasons over the last few millennia to hate each other (but hey, anyone who is stuck with the same roommate for so long would too)-- yet despite this, many of them don't.    Embed Quote
