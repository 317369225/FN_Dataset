Question That Contains Assumptions: Why are 99% of successful people married?
I don't know where the 99% came from. I will take that it is just a number and what you are asking is why so many of the successful people you know about are also married. I would think that it is because virtually all of us human beings envision our lives as shared lives, not as lonesome eccentrics. Then when it comes down to successful people, by definition, they succeed in carrying out their plans, and if a lot of them view marriage as one of their life goals, then they will be married because they succeed in accomplishing their goals.    Embed Quote
