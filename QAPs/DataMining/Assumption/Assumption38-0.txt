★What is the great childhood assumption which gets a humongous shift after we mature or become old enough?
Our parents are stupid, mean, unfair, etc.  The quote attributed to Mark Twain says it well:  "When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.”    Embed Quote
