★What is the most bizarre assumption made about atheists?
Probably the assumption that atheists have no reason to do good baffles me most! More than the affront that carries, it makes me question your reasons for doing good. Some other assumptions that are bizarre :- Atheists are pessimistic :- This comes from people's understanding the optimism is supported by the belief that the higher being is going to fix things for you. In fact, I think it is more of an irrational hope to keep oneself under control and not freak out as soon as things start going bad. In fact, pessimism is also another method to tackle the same thing. Pessimists try to think so badly about the future, that they are either right or happy :) Atheists hate theists :- Firstly, most atheists have many around them, friends and families, who are theists. Secondly, most atheists (I hope I can speak for them) believe that religion has some advantages and as long as your religion is not shoved down my throat, I wouldn't bother discussing it. Atheists haven't had education about religion : Again, most atheists have friends and family who are theists and most of us, as children, have heard/read various tales related to religion. In fact, my observation tells me that most atheists are better well read in religion than believers. I don't mean to mock believers here but merely point out that what believers might take for granted is not so easily accepted by atheists and in their search for answers, they might end up learning a lot more about religion.    Embed Quote Updated 2 Jan, 2013. 536 views.
