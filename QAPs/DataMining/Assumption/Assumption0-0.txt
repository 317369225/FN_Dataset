★What is an assumption that people often wrongly make?
That we are too young or too old to do something. That once an event happens, we can start doing what they really want to do, follow the passion, live the dream. They postpone happiness until the next promotion, the move to another city, the baby grows up, the relationship matures, the mother-in-law dies, the market becomes more conducive, the government gives subsidies, prices fall.. and so on. This quest for the 'perfect' leads many of us to paralysis. The right time is now. The right person is you. The right thing to do is what makes you deeply happy.    Embed Quote
