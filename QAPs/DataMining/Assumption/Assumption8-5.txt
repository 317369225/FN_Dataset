★Behavioral Economics: What are the most controversial assumptions of economics?
The market will correct itself - Actually, a lot of people believe(still believe) in this. Market in itself is so complex that one could not adequately make assumptions on how it will work in the long run. Market(s) will tend to "correct itself" once we realize that the current circumstances is under what we deemed "incorrect(bubble, etc)" because the action(s) after the realization would obviously on the corrective side and by then things will start to crumble. Not saying that the theory is entirely false, just wanted to point out that the market is so complex for us the have a clear cut take that market will autonomously take corrective action, on itself.    Embed Quote
