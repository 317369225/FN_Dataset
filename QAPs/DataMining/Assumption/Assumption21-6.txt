★What are the debates in the US today that will seem like assumptions within the next 100 years?
A few: We will have moved further from a currency system monopolized by the government. I am no expert on Bitcoin and the others but I do believe some healthy and viable alternatives to a state-sponsored currency will exist in 100 years once they fix the inevitable problems with bad actors that plague the birth of many new technogies. E.g., Mt. Gox. Even more interestingly, we will have more and better platforms that allow people to bypass the currency system altogether and engage in more bartered transactions. Some startups are working in this now and it is fascinating to think what you can accomplish without using money as a transactional ingredient. We will have fewer restrictions on abortion and birth control. People will stil debate some types of regulations vigorously but more people will regard most abortion procedures as standard medical decisions and not fundamentally moral issues and this will translate into somewhat more permissive laws. In America, the social concept of "race" will continue to evolve and become less relevant as a way to categorize humans. This has nothing to do with President Obama. It has to do with a demographic trend (the number of mixed-race marriages, people who date and socialize between racial groups, and have mixed-race children is zooming) and one recent, new government policy (in 2000 the U.S. Census began allowing people to check more than one "race" box, and found out to the surprise of some people that's ton of Americans view themselves as members of multie groups -- or of no groups.  In time the government's awareness of this growing phenomenon may translate into different public policies).    Embed Quote
