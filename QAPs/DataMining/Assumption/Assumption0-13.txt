★What is an assumption that people often wrongly make?
1) To mistake correlation for causation. Very easy to mix them up and then derive wrong conclusions. Some of these conclusions can be really funny though : Facebook caused the Greek Debt Crisis Internet Explorer was responsible for increased murder rate in US  2) Not account for sampling bias : The sample one chooses to define a universe should be free of biases, and  since this is never the case, one erroneously draws wrong conclusions. You survey Indians on Quora on what tv shows they like and conclude that Game of Thrones is the most watched tv show. Also, a lot of people generally extrapolate the results of sample to form a generalization. Like, the smartest kid in Mathematics in your class is someone from Sweden and you conclude that Swedish are good in Mathematics. 3) Look at only one metrics  : Even when the data is right, looking at only one metric never tells you the complete picture. A lot of things get auto assumed. Like GDP numbers do not give a clear picture on how strong an economy is. The graph below tells you how looking at different metrics is needed to avoid making obvious assumptions. While France is visited by most tourists, per head spend is lowest. So, just using the tourist numbers to understand tourism industry will be a flawed attempt.    Embed Quote
