Economics: What are the most significant flawed assumptions in economics?
The Washington Consensus comes to mind. The belief was that liberalization of markets would solve most of the problems in the developing world. Economists with the IMF and the World Bank saw that the markets in poor countries were often heavily regulated, state-owned, and inefficient. They reasoned that if the markets were liberalized--mainly if the state-owned monopolies were sold off to, and managed by, the private sector, that would go a long way toward fixing those countries problems. Economists were so enamored by it that they often made liberalization a condition of receiving foreign aid or help with currency stabilization. However, they never really considered how to liberalize the markets. There wouldn't be enough money to sell the companies for their fair value. And there wouldn't be the knowledge or the trust or the infrastructure to hold IPOs where the general population could own a reasonable share. Often the companies were sold off by corrupt governments to people with the most political capital. If you had influence, you get a huge company for a song. The liberalization in Egypt are a great example of this. The companies are massive effectively monopolies. And the owners like to see their friends in power. Hosni Mubarak might be worth as much as $70 billion. Carlos (not so) Slim and Telmex are a similar story. Slim organized a buy-out of the state-owned monopoly on extremely favorable terms (he didn't have to pay out all the cash up front), and has been throwing money at the Mexican government to keep his monopoly powers. Unfortunately, it's a familiar story throughout the third world. The economists were so focused on privatizing industry, that they didn't stop to think how the industry should be privatized.    Embed Quote Updated 4 Mar. 1,013 views.
