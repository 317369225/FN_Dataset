Question That Contains Assumptions: Is a mass conversion to Islam taking place in India?
No. This is a divisive story run by rightist organizations. They try to potray that it is the Muslims responsible for the population boom but actually its our poverty. Also, the Indian Muslims have co-existed for over a millennia and shall continue to do so. Please don't fall into the traps of rightist people    Embed Quote
