What are the assumptive flaws of atheism/skepticism?
I thought the point of Quora was to ask questions, not give lectures. But in response to your comments: a) I don't know what a 'world of atheism' looks like, but if you're claiming that atheists can't have ethics or a purpose, that's clearly wrong because there are plenty of examples of atheists who do. b) Nor do I know what 'absolute scepticism' is. Perhaps you could give a definition, and then we could try and establish if there's anyone to whom it applies. But if you mean 'refusal to believe anything', that doesn't apply to any atheist I know. We're quite happy to believe things, as long as there is adequate evidence for them. c) History relies on whatever evidence it can get. Whether you call this 'knowledge' is up to you, but it's clear that historians value objective and scientific information as much as anyone else when they can get it. A large part of the progress of history involves finding objective and scientific evidence for things that are currently only known by hearsay. So let me respond to your answer with a question: Do you actually know any atheists?    Embed Quote
