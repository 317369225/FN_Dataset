Do all questions contain assumptions?
Yes of course.  If they have meaning at all it is in relationship to a semantic world of some kind.  The unspecified features of that world are assumptions.  No one can understand, let alone answer, a question without setting aside some of those features and picking up others.    Embed Quote
