Why is it bad to ask questions that contain assumptions?
I was under the assumption :-) that the tag was for loaded questions That is, questions that cannot be answered at face value without agreeing to an assumption not agreed upon by the answerer For example - this is a loaded question: Why do black people like fish tanks more than white people? It assumes that aquatic hobbies are some much a part of black culture we can make generalizations (stereotype) Instead of Do black people like fishtanks more than others? (this ...or something similar really was a question. I don't just question the op's assumptions, I question their critical thinking skills...but I digress) However, I have noticed many people (all kinds, all places in the quora pecking order) add this and other limiting tags in order to shut down a question they don't like and leave perfectly presumptuous questions they approve of. So my assumption must be incorrect.
