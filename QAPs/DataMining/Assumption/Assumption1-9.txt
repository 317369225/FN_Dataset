★Is it a safe assumption to say that human history would be less violent without religion?
There are few if any examples of democracies going to war against other democracies.  And it's safe to say that nearly every strong democracy is very tolerant of religious diversity.  The ongoing sunni-shia, muslim-christian, muslim-hindu, muslim-jewish conflicts probably reflect the lust for power of religious leaders and the politicians who exploit that rather than actual religious doctrine.  But that just shows that religion is largely a cover for power (or money)-grabs by religious leaders.  So, yes, there would be a lot less violence without religious leaders whipping their followers into frenzies of hatred.    Embed Quote
