★What were your misconceptions as a kid?
Let's see... I used to think that, when you changed lanes in a car, you just signaled which lane you wanted to go to, and the car automatically moved over for you. My idea was that there were electromagnets on the roads and in the cars, so it was impossible to leave your lane unless you asked the road to turn them off first.    Embed Quote
