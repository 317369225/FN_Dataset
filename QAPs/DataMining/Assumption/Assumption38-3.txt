★What is the great childhood assumption which gets a humongous shift after we mature or become old enough?
We believe when we are children that when we grow up, we can do whatever we want.  We believe that no one can tell us what we can or can't do.  Some of us do get to live our lives that way, but most of us don't.  We don't realize as children the obligations and responsibility that will be placed on our shoulders.  We don't realize as children the fact that for some of us, our biggest obstacle will be ourselves.    Embed Quote
