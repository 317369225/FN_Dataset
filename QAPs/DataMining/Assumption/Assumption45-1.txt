Question That Contains Assumptions: Why are 99% of successful people married?
Let's look at the business world. Firstly if you are running a business or enterprise its an obsession, your life really can fall apart if you don't have someone to tell you to wash, eat regular meals and give you something else to focus on. You also get remarkable amounts of feedback, plus you can never be in two places at once, even basic stuff like opening mail and banking checks or someone to remind you to do the obvious. You can of course pay people to do any of this, but the key thing is you have someone you can trust, can ask to do unreasonable things and has an emotional investment in your success. When you are starting out you will need to make contact with a lot more older conservative people. Being married makes you look more stable and partners will have their own network circles. You also are seen as more as a threat if you are single. At the most basic two people working together stand more chance of success, even if only one gets the glory.    Embed Quote
