Question with assumptions:  Why do Jews and Muslims hate each other?
Most Jews, including Israelis, do not hate Muslims. Some have come to be suspicious of Muslims due to the long history of religiously inspired terrorism committed against Jews and Israelis in and outside of Israel. But Israeli society, as well as the legal system, is very tolerant of Islam and of Muslims, much more so than many European countries for example. I personally find the tolerance of Israelis to be very admirable considering their historical experience. It should be noted that unlike what some others have written here, that no Palestinians were expelled by anyone until the war in 1948, when the Jews of Israel were attacked by numerous Arab armies with the expressed intention of carrying out a genocide. In the course of the fighting in that war, a lot of people became refugees (Arabs in areas involved in the fighting or who fled, and Jews who were expelled from Arab countries and subsequently absorbed in Israel).    Embed Quote Updated 31 Jul, 2014. 1,091 views.
