Does mathematics really exist in the universe or is it just a human assumption?
Rephrase the question as: does human language really exist in the world or is it just a human assumption? Both questions have the same answer. Think about it this way: in the same vein that English was invented to communicate verbal ideas to one another, like war, peace, philosophy, and religion, mathematics was invented to convey abstract concepts like numerosity, rates of change, topology, and infinities. It would be very hard to meaningfully discuss Quantum Mechanics with just the English language (how on Earth would I even begin to describe the second-order differential that is Schrodinger's equation?), just as it would be impossible to paraphrase Shakespeare's work using nothing but numbers, operations, and functions of variables. These both are merely language systems conceptualized to serve more or less utility under different contexts. So replace "mathematics" in your question with "English" or "Spanish" or "Arabic" or "Japanese" and you'll realize that the question is kind of absurd. Was human language really ever "assumed", or was it merely invented? Did we simply assume that the four-legged object before me had a name, or did we just arbitrarily decide to call it a "chair"? Regardless, what I know for certain is that mathematics, like English, was invented to be used in our everyday communication. So yes, math does really exist in our universe. And I guess it must have been assumed, too.    Embed Quote
