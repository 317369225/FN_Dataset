What are some examples of stupid assumptions that intelligent people often make?
One assumption I can safely say I have witnessed second hand, through my former fiance's medical training, is when a professional, let's say a Cardiologist, tells a patient:  "You can't get pregnant." And assumes that the patient interprets that statement correctly. The moral is to never assume that the sentences one utters have been understood in the correct fashion. In the specific instance I heard about, one may have said, "It is not in your best interests to get pregnant. You will bring a life into this world while sacrificing your own." *Note* The "regularly" I am referring to is for smart people to assume that the people they are talking to understand their exact meaning.    Embed Quote Updated 28 Sep, 2012. 524 views.
