Is it a common assumption that an atheist is immoral and depraved?
I get the impression that these kind of negative connotations about atheism is mostly a Muslim and US Christian thing. New Zealand, where I live, is one of the least religious countries in the world and there is nothing negative about atheism. To the contrary. Homobigots amongst Christians are viewed as immoral and Christians trying to force their religion upon others are viewed with suspicion.    Embed Quote
