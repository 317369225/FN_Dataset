Economics: What are the most significant flawed assumptions in economics?
I'll stick with the ones I see most commonly here on Quora. I'll start with the unflawed way of looking at it, and then discuss the flawed view.   In transactions of trade, it is not to be suppos'd that like gaming, what one party gains the other must necessarily lose.  The gain to each may be equal.  If A had more corn than he can consume, but wants cattle, and B has more cattle but wants corn, an exchange is a gain to each; hereby the common stock of comforts in life is increas'd.                                                 --Benjamin Franklin, 1783   To many, commerce is one big zero-sum poker game with a big winner, one or two who come out a little ahead and other players who get fleeced. This is far from the case. It is true that most transactions are zero-sum, but, just as in Franklin's example, to mutual advantage or the parties do not conclude the transaction. Profits, however, represent the one non-zero-sum transaction--something is left over after all the zero-sum wages, rents and sales have been concluded. This makes commerce the opposite of poker games; everyone can come out a winner.   Free enterprise is able to satisfy all commercial needs, amazingly, even ones it does not anticipate.                                    ______________________   The very idea that profits "trickle down" to workers depicts the economic sequence of events in the opposite order from that in the real world.  Workers must first be hired, and commitments made to pay them, before there is any output produced to sell for a profit, and independently of whether that output subsequently sells for a profit or at a loss.  With many investments, whether they lead to a profit or a loss can often be determined only years later, and workers have to be paid in the meantime, rather than waiting for profits to "trickle down" to them.  The real effect of tax rate reductions is to make the future prospects of profit look more favorable, leading to more current investments that generate more current economic activity and more jobs.                                                 --Thomas Sowell, 2012 I have a dusty memory of a Soviet emissary being shown a well-stocked American supermarket back around the Carter administration. "Yes, but who can afford to buy such goods?" he scoffed. Say's Law, propounded by Jean Baptiste Say in the early 1800s, states that the very existence of such goods IS the ability to buy them.   Sowell explains how this is true. To get a product to market requires spending a lot of money a lot of ways. By the time the product gets to market, the money needed to purchase it has already diffused through the economy. In this way, every new product creates demand for other new products. Every new business creates demand for other new businesses. A successful insurance agency helps create demand for an ice cream parlor.   This is the prosperity cycle that creates jobs, wealth and all the slick gadgets we like to buy. How many times, though, have I seen commenters here on Quora who think like the Soviet emissary that it is the job of government to adjust wages and infuse money into the economy so that such goods can be afforded.                                    ______________________   Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.                                     --Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, 1776 Smith is stating the flip side of Say's Law. Production, the world of creating products and services offers considerable benefit to society apart from its benefit to consumers. We get jobs, leases, taxes, and so on. What Smith is pointing out is that those benefits are and must be treated as secondary.   Purchasing power is all. Wages are part but not the end. Prices are part but not the end. We have dual lives as both earners and consumers. How many hours must you labor in order to acquire this product is the real consideration. The takeaway here, contrary to the many I see who take the productive sector as a primary benefit, is that market competition and free trade are always to be preferred--they benefit consumers. Price and wage fixing and manipulation, bailouts, cronyism and other forms of Rent-seeking on behalf of the productive sector are always to be avoided.                                    ______________________   When you get right down to it, Keynesianism is just a convenient excuse for what the left wants to do anyway, spend more government money.                      --Don Boudreaux, George Mason University, 2011   What few know is that there is no meaningful theoretical or empirical support for the Keynesian position.                      --Robert Barro, Harvard University, 2011 In every economic school but one, money matters. Getting money into the productive sector, kick-starting the prosperity cycle, cures all ills. Trouble is, from a certain point of view anyway, that puts capitalists in the driver seat and makes handmaidens of politicians. John Maynard Keynes became the darling of politicians when, in the book that put him on the map, he claimed that money was more than a medium of transaction; it could also be a temporary store of wealth. This gave more rationale for politicians to jigger with economics.   During the Great Depression (created largely by his own actions at the Genoa Conference on behalf of the UK), he got bolder still and declared, "Money doesn't matter." This was his plea on behalf of political, that is, fiscal, interventions into the economy--taxes, wage and price controls and other measures that attempt to increase demand rather than production contra all the solid economic thinking above.   This turned politicians into the Wizard of Oz, able to thunder and roar their fiscal nostrums while pretending to pull the levers of the economy (while in fact using tax money to increase their own political power). His economics is credited with finally providing an economic rationale for progressivism/social democracy. Only, it never worked. It was discredited with the stagflation of the Carter years, something that could not exist according to Keynesian theory. Nevertheless, it's back with the next progressive administration, that of Obama and reliably producing the same malaise. Many here on Quora seem not to realize that Keynesianism is discredited; indeed, they view it as the one true economics, for without it, there is no basis for progressivism.   Charles Tips' answer to Why does there need to be inflation?
