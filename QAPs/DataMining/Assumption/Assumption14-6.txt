What is the most fundamental assumption of Christianity?
That words have meaning and can be used to transmit objective information with a high degree of accuracy. Christianity is a religion if revelation. God revealed Himself in Creation, using words. He revealed Himself to Abraham, using words. He revealed Himself in Christ, not only in words but certainly not apart from words. He revealed Himself in the pages of Scripture, again, through words. The whole project of Christianity breaks down if words have no meaning and/or cannot transmit information with a great deal of accuracy.    Embed Quote
