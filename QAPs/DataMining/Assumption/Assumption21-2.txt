★What are the debates in the US today that will seem like assumptions within the next 100 years?
Inter-cultural interactions (socially, romantically)In a place like Toronto, which is one of the most multi-cultural cities in the world, immigrant families have primary interactions with only their own culture. The exceptions are: work, education, shopping. This is changing with my generation, and in a 100 years, cultural silos will no longer exist. Cross-cultural relationships will become the norm. The question is if cultures will retain identity or just melt into one urban megacity pot. Global WarmingFor the record, I hate the term Global Warming. I prefer to think of the problem as Global Resource Exploitation. The symptom is Global Warming (or better yet, Climate Change). But we will come to some resolution about it once we stop focusing on symptoms and going to root causes and changing our entire infrastructure on a global scale. EducationI think the next 100 years will be great for education on all levels. Technologically, socially and from a policy perspective. We will find new ways to teach, methods that are customized to individual learning habits, systems that are not biased towards those with money or connections (okay maybe thats a pipedream). I think the real debate hasn't started with this, and possibly in the next 10-20 years as new models of education come about, a lot of institutions will react back.    Embed Quote
