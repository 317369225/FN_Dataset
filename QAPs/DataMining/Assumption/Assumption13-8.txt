What are your base assumptions?
1. Cogito, ergo sum. I think, therefore I am. This for is like a verification of my existence in this universe. 2. Reality is very basic and it's versions, myriad. What exactly is reality is still a matter confusion. Until that is resolved, the only thing matters to me is my existence. I believe, we live among illusions. 3. "I act" is an illusion. What I want to say here is that one does't really 'act' for the sake of it. One needs a reason to act. That reason is what is causing action, not you. Even if you don't need to act, but you act, that action is because you desire to act. And that becomes the reason. 4. Desire is the key to pain. 5. I exist to achieve the highest state of existence. I believe that my life is an opportunity to achieve a highest state of spirituality.    Embed Quote
