★What is the most bizarre assumption made about atheists?
I don't often hear crazy comments about atheism, because they're not common in the circles I'm usually in, but I recall with great amusement hearing that a prominent yoga lecturer, on presenting his grocery purchases at checkout in a the Southeast US was asked, "Are you an atheist?!" because he had no meat in his cart. I had no idea that some people equated vegetarianism and atheism.    Embed Quote
