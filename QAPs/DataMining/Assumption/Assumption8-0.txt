★Behavioral Economics: What are the most controversial assumptions of economics?
Economists assume Self-Interest. In theory, this is very general and can include all kinds of motives including Altruism. In practice, however, economists as people tend towards a narrow interpretation of self-interest and thus they try to explain all behavior in terms of that narrow interpretation. e.g. Charitable Giving is "really" about getting a good Reputation, Religion is really about generating social cooperation and Public Goods, Bravery is really a way to get girls, and so forth. As a result of this narrow conception of self-interest (which as I said is more about economists as people rather than as a discipline) economists have a difficult time with ideas like Culture and Identity because they feel they need to interpret these in terms of wealth maximization or more basic desires. It's this desire to interpret everything in narrowly self-interested terms which I think can impede conversation with colleagues in other disciplines.    Embed Quote Updated 1 Jan. 12,691 views.
