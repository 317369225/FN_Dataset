What is the most ridiculous assumption that is generally regarded as true?
There are so many, but here are a few that come to mind: -That the war on drugs will create less drugs, and less drug users. -That a war on poverty will create less poverty. -That the war on terrorism will create less terrorism. -That if drugs were legal, there would be a lot more crime. -That if we lived in a resource-based economy and made money obsolete, that people would become lazy and wouldn't work towards the betterment of mankind.    Embed Quote
