Question That Contains Assumptions: Is a mass conversion to Islam taking place in India?
Take a moment to think. Name 5 people you personally know who converted to Islam recently. Can't? Okay, do this.. Ask 5 people you personally know if they know 5 people who converted to Islam. Still nothing? Continue this cycle until you find 5 such people! But i doubt if it still qualifies as "Mass conversion" at that point.    Embed Quote
