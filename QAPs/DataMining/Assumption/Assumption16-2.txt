What is the biggest assumption people make about you that is not true?
Most people brand me as being arrogant and haughty. I am one of those people who is seldom liked after the first meeting. But  I'm just a simple introvert who doesn't care much about small talk. If you ask me what I ate today, I'll tell you. But, please don't expect me to ask you the same. I just don't care. Cut the bullshit and tell me exactly what you came to tell me. Till then, I'll just stay silent and think of more productive things.    Embed Quote
