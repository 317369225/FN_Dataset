Can you make an assumption about me?
Sure. You are a 5'6" albino who likes heavy metal and crochet. That's an assumption. Also a made-up, arbitrary guess. With scant likelihood of accuracy. Assumptions are what you do when you are forced to guess. They are only as good as your starting information and how much care you give to your Bayesian priors.    Embed Quote
