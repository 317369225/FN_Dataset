What is the best way to challenge your assumptions?
I asked the question--but thought I would get the ball rolling.  Here are 10 possible ways to help identify your assumptions: Use a checklist style method Create a matrix which compares yourself, your industry or peers, and a possible future (or the alternative ways to make that specific choice.) Spreadsheet (quantitative) Identify unknowns (yourself, survey industry leaders, survey leaders in your company, or frontline workers in your company).  Seek out black boxes and leverage them as new opportunities for listening, learning, and growth where possible. Create data (qualitative or quantitative).  Create a feedback loop (ideally one embedded in the process).  This allows you to create a more systems approach to your problem. Design Thinking methodology/Service Design Thinking methodology The Habit of Being Self-Reflective (Journaling can help unpack your unconscious thoughts in a more tangible way).  Hopefully this is at all levels of the organization--to some extent.  Go directly to the source if possible.  Keep asking how we do it?  why? Six sigma offers some insights (actually any problem solving method should) FYI: Numbers 2 and 3 are essentially the same method--the just deal with different types of data.  Also, a number of these could be combined.    Embed Quote
