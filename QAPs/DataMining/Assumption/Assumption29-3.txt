What are good assumptions about people?
It's not that they don't give a shit, on purpose, it's not that they don't care. Most people are simply busy dealing with their own shit and not aware that you possibly have (very different or the same) shit going on. Never attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance. So what are good assumptions? You can assume that they probably don't know what your life is like; they only know what their life is like. Empathy is difficult and doesn't come naturally to everyone. You can assume that half of the time, they don't really know what they're doing and they're probably just going with the flow; very few people come into this world prepared and informed about everything.    Embed Quote
