Question That Contains Assumptions: Why are 99% of successful people married?
This is not true at all. Success has got nothing to do with one's marital status. There are many rich and successful bachelors (and spinsters). A few examples are: Coco Chanel - The famous fashion designer and founder of Chanel. Wright brothers - The inventors of the aviation technology. Jack Dorsey - one of the co-founders of Twitter, and the founder and CEO of Square, a mobile payments company. In 2012, he was awarded the "Innovator of the Year Award (Technology)" by the Wall Street Journal. Net-worth - $1.1 billion. Eduardo Saverin - a co-founder of Facebook. Net-worth - $2.2 billion Xavier Niel - a French entrepreneur and bussinessman. Creater and founder of Free (ISP), a provider of voice, video, data, and Internet telecommunications in France, and of Free Mobile. Net-worth - $11.7 billion.EDIT 2: I had to add some exemplary successful bachelors from India too. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam - Former Indian President and one of the leading and best aviation scientists in India. Narendra Modi - The current prime minister of India, who rose from a tea-seller to leading the nation. He was married once, but has been separated from his wife since 1968, so I hope his bachelor status counts.

EDIT 1: The original question was : Why all successful people are married?, and my answer was in sync with it. However, I still stand by the fact that, according to me, success is not proportional to one's marital status. There have been many other examples where successful people have married their partners after already having established their success. The most famous examples are Mark Zuckerbeg, who married after Facebook was already a world-wide success. Same goes for George Clooney who recently wed his lawyer girlfriend.    Embed Quote
