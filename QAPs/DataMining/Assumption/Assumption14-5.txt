What is the most fundamental assumption of Christianity?
That Christian scripture contains some element of truth.  Beyond that there are so many divergent theological viewpoints contained within Christianity that it would be impossible to make any of them match each other.  Technically, the term is applied to those who believe there was something special about Jesus, but even going with that definition, it is hard to define exactly what that "something special" is/was.    Embed Quote
