How do I stop making assumptions?
It not assumptions that deprive you of curiosity, it's bad forecast or negative thoughts. Assumptions are nessasary for long term goals. You can't set your target/forecast without assumptions. Example - you want to go on a trip with your friends on bike. You might assume 1. Roads and driving is not safe. 2. Won't be able to find like minded people to go on trip together. 3. It will rain on the traveling day. 4. Bike might break-down in a lone area. Worst of all 5. It will be a boring and good for nothing trip. These are not just assumptions, these are assumptions plagued by negativity. All normal people make assumptions to prepare for the worst, but you must hope for the best too. Or else all the fun will be lost. Clear your mind of all the negativity. If you are accustomed to sleep late at night, change your sleeping pattern and rise early. This will directly influence your perception towards life. Don't think too much, just do it.    Embed Quote
