What are good assumptions about people?
The only really safe assumption you can make about other people is that they are human beings with their own emotions, flaws, hopes, dreams and goals. They may not behave entirely rationally, they may not see things your way but there will always be a reason for their behaviour - and you should start from the assumption that they won't fall into line with what you want unless you can persuade them that it's in their interests too. Seek first to understand. Find out what matters to them, and frame things from their frame of reference. You'll get on much better with people that way, and they'll be much more willing to help you.    Embed Quote
