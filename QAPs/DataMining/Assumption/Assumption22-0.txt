Question That Contains Assumptions: Why are Iranians so good-looking?
From the appearance perspective, it is mainly rooted in culture. Persians are poetic people, and have always valued aesthetics and luxury living.

They take on the finer points of life, and they definitely take care of their looks. Everything from the materials used in your house to how you decorate it, designer clothing to how you wear, and walk in it are of importance to Iranians. That's one of the dominating reasons that the majority wealthy group of Iranians are usually good looking.
