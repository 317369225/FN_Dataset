Question That Contains Assumptions: Why are Iranians so good-looking?
Iranians are kindhearted people. Lots of famous poets, inventors, doctors, are Iranian. In Iran, education was the top priority. As for the attractiveness, they are the descendants of the Aryans, considered Caucasian, and White. Every nationality has its beauty and good qualities. In the end they are wonderful people, just like any other human race, and there's no need to discriminate, good or bad. I hope this helps. :)    Embed Quote
