Do you assume that an assumption is a wrong act?
You always have to assume something...it's binary. Information that would replace assumption is itself something that we assume to be correct. Ultimately anything actual infortmation that would correct an assumption is based on assuming that our thoughts are rational It's normally better to assume your perceptions aren't lying to you for instance. When you've been awake 3 nights and you think the police are trailing you, it's better to assume your perceptions are wrong this time.    Embed Quote
