Occam's Razor - Which is simpler (fewest assumptions), atheism or theism? Why or why not?
If X is designed, then the designer must have all the details of X in their mind (plus, realistically, alternative and inferior versions of X). Therefore, if the universe is designed, it must have been designed by a mind more complex/ordered/improbable than the universe, such that all of the universe's features can exist within the designer's mind. Any notion of design, either deism or theism, then escalates the assumed complexity of the universe in trying to explain it. The universe seems improbable and 'fine-tuned', but the designer has to be even more improbable and 'fine-tuned' to do the job, just as a painter is a massive escalation in complexity/improbability/assumptions from a painting.  Atheism rejects any primal designer, and scientifically-informed atheism assumes that self-assembly mechanisms (evolution, etc.) can build up the universe's complexity without a designer, slowly accumulating slightly improbable outcomes to produce very improbable end products like human brains, trees, squid, etc. The 'painting' may have its features like a snowflake, which forms because of the self-assembly of water molecules - it does not need intelligent orders to form.    Embed Quote
