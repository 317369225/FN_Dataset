What are your base assumptions?
Stay Curious. Variety is the spice of life in every way. Never stop learning and never be satisfied that you know all there is to know. You can always strive to learn more or learn something new. Explore, Dream and Discover. New adventures await you in every direction but you need to seek them out. Knowledge Exists to be Shared. Share what you know if it is appropriate and sincerely try to learn from others. Stay Humble. The ties that bind us are greater than the ones that separate us. Life is precious, precarious and random, no matter if you are Bill Gates or Ariel Williams it could end at any time. When you die everything you owned becomes meaningless and your skills are lost to the world. Pay it Forward. Leave behind a world better than the one you entered, at least sincerely try.. Given enough time everything you do is likely to be forgotten and everything you built is likely to be destroyed. However, what you leave behind for the next generation can provide stepping stones to human achievements that will echo forever. Be Responsible. Take responsibility for yourself, your actions and the consequences of your actions. Do this even if it is not your "fault". It is Better to be Kind Than to be Right. Nobody likes a know it all but everyone loves a kind heart. Three Simple Rules. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Do as you will so long as you harm none, including self. Apply the previous two rules to themselves when using them.    Embed Quote
