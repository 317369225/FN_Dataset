How do I stop making assumptions?
Assumptions!!!!!! Anything which is interpreted beyond what is conveyed is assuming. We all get used to deriving meanings of what is spoken/conveyed. You definitely have to be conscious of observing What was the real message And also what meaning u derived. Plz think of how did u derive that unspoken meaning! What words, gestures conveyed this meaning, and if it was worth interpreting that meaning! It will help you continue assuming or discarding assumption. Quick checks Try not to generalise either common instances  (of self or others) as a pattern for all (people may have unique experiences,  preferences and reactions to it) Try and not predict others actions and reactions. Try and identify your biases. Accept them and deal with them consciously. Ask questions to confirm your assumptions or patterns derived. What actually does not bother you, should be left without assuming anyways. And at times, with close people, it's the trickiest, they want you to know them in small amount of experiences and yet not predict them as well as understand them. Just be open to know them as they are and don't allow yourself to believe that you know them till they confirm it in long run. Flow like water. Please note: there are some generalisations, which help you lead regular life. They are assumptions too. They are healthy assumptions as far as they do not disturb your people involved in it, and  contradict with what they want to convey. They might be considered as normal actions for them. But unfortunately there is no definition of word "normal". Hence, keep observing to derive them.    Embed Quote
