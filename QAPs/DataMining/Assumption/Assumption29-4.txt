What are good assumptions about people?
Well I'm not necessarily sure that it's detrimental to your long term mental health. It can be very liberating to know that no one cares or gives a shit.  But anyways, that's not the question. What keeps me optimistic is a good sense of humor, faith in my fellow man, and compassion. There will be times in most peoples lives when they will be exploited and there will be nothing that can be done about it. Hopefully they will be able to laugh it off and think back to the time when they had no other alternative than to take a bite of the shit sandwich. Obviously some situations are no laughing matter, like exploiting children, but hopefully that person can be helped. I also know that there are people out there who will take advantage of others given the opportunity, and I'd say a good amount of the time you can see them coming a mile away. Every now-and-then you get that snake in the grass though. Once it becomes known who that person really is, what happens? No one trusts them, and no one associates with them, business or otherwise. Can you imagine having no friends? No one to help you out? No one who will do business with you? Look at OJ Simpson. He got away murder, but his life after the trial was not very glamorous. I remember reading an article about a restaurant owner refusing him business, and the restaurant owner was on the Internet being hailed as a hero. Imagine being told a restaurant would not serve you because of who you are. So in the end, I just feel sorry for people exploit others, it doesn't feel good and burns a lot of bridges. When people see that you're in a position to easily exploit them and you don't, they remember that, for a long time. And when you do, they remember that for a long time too. Plus depending on you piss off you, may be looking over your shoulder for a long time, and that's just no way to live.    Embed Quote
