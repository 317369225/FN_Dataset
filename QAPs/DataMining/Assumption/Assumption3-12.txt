What is the most ridiculous assumption that is generally regarded as true?
That, in a lifetime, the average person ingests eight spiders in his or her sleep. More an urban legend than an assumption, but it comes up a lot and, at least in my experience, people all nod and rarely give it a second thought. I've never heard someone stop the conversation and say, "Wait, eight spiders on average? In a lifetime? No no no no no no no show me the study then, because that's absurd. What was the sample size? Or the methodology, because seriously, how could anyone possibly measure that over an entire lifetime. Or even estimate it, if the whole point is that you wake up and don't know you've done it, so..." etc.    Embed Quote
