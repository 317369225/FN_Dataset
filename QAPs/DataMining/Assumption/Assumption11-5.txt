Questions with assumptions: Why is science immune from criticism, despite constantly changing answers?
To give you a simplified example, lets take the shape of the world. Intuitively on human scale, the world is effectively flat. Then scientists discovered it was round. A while later, it turns out it was actually slightly egg-shaped rather than perfectly round. It might look like scientists are changing their answers, but really they're getting closer and closer to the truth. A similar example if you're interested is the model of the atom, from the ancient Greek idea, to the "ball" of matter, to the model we have today. Secondly, and you quite obviously know this because of the formulation of your question, science is constantly critiqued.  If scientists never changed their minds we'd still think the world was flat, and atoms were balls of matter.  It's by testing contrary or new theories that scientists can find flaws in current theories.    Embed Quote
