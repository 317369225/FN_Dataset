What is the most fundamental assumption in the history of physics?
Good question.  In general you want to have as few assumptions as possible. I can't think of any unwritten assumptions except perhaps the "axiom of choice" You might also add things like "We assume that what we see actually exists and that we are not dreaming".    Embed Quote
