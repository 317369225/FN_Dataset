What is the best way to challenge your assumptions?
You have to look at the question from another perspective. Interesting way to do this is tarot cards. Approach the question however the cards tell you to. They don't have some supernatural quality that will give you the right answer, but they can force you to look at the question in a different way, which can lead you to the right answer.    Embed Quote
