★What were your misconceptions as a kid?
I used to think Enid Blyton was a man and Sidney Sheldon was a woman. (To the child me, their names made me think so :P) I had my sweet moment(s) of truth when I was 16  there was an answer in a quiz which said Helena Bonham Carter (the Bellatrix Letrange woman) would play Enid's role in a documentary. (Side: They do look quite similar) I was so stunned (thinking that I had lived my entire childhood thinking that Enid Blyton was a man) that I checked up every author that I had read (yes, quite crazy), and guess what I found : Sidney Sheldon, was in fact, a man.    Embed Quote
