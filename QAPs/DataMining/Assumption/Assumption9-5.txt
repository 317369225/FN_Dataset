If mathematics is an exact science, why are there assumptions?
Because even an exact science needs a human frame of reference. David W. Budd's answer has encouraged me a bit to elaborate(hope he is still with me): The exact science will only be exact within this set of assumptions and meaningless(not just vague) outside of it. It also has one important implied assumption, i.e. "nothing else matters". Thus exact science requires for these assumptions to be and stay very focussed and narrow. (Don't worry you can still build impressive cathedrals even if you have to use ISO-norm bricks.) Statistics for instance creates a border situation where exact mathematical principles meet the real imprecise world. It feeds a narrow frame of references back into a whole range of loose and arbitrary references. Statistics is exact(or let's say vague in a controlled way). Data collection and most of all interpretation is not.    Embed Quote
