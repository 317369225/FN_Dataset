★What are the debates in the US today that will seem like assumptions within the next 100 years?
Wow, as I read this page I'm shocked at how little people think is going to happen in 100 years. With the exponential growth of computational power, A.I., and cryptocurrencies all during that time, I can't see ANY issues we can dream about today not being caveman-like in 100 years from now. The most major two are obviously going to be government and age-related mortality. Neither will exist in any form whatsoever within that 100 years. Maybe even just 50. Mankind will eventually realize that no man is fit to rule over any other man and governments will be thought of like we think of the Spanish Inquisition in just a few dozen years or less. Then as A.I. becomes truly useful and our hardware-based brain upgrades will be needed to keep up with them, (You'll be able to simply download 20 years of schooling one day for a few millibits that make our current school education look like an afternoon reading the comics!) we'll become a whole new species that is part borg, part Q. Imagine what billions of people doing just the hardware upgrades would achieve. Nevermind; you can't. It would take those upgraded brains to even get close.    Embed Quote
