What are the assumptive flaws of atheism/skepticism?
Your initial statement "You can't have ethics, purpose, or meaning in a world of atheism" is simply false. You just have to have a source of ethics which is not based on a believe in God. (I do not speak for "absolute skepticism" because I don't know what that is: it would mean doubting everything, including one's own existence). Your statement can be recast as "You cannot be ethical if you are not ethical as I am". I, as many other atheists, get my ethics from Humanism - the respect of my fellow humans as absolute equals. Or "Love thy neighbour as thyself" as it has been memorably put). The rest of you question I have not disentangled, because it is obvious that you are starting from a totally false premise.    Embed Quote
