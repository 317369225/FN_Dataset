Question with assumptions:  Why do Jews and Muslims hate each other?
I dislike, or at least do not respect, all religious believers.  Adults shouldn't believe in fairy tales, much less organize their lives around them and even impose them on others. That said, nearly all the current antipathy between jews and muslims is ultimately a political dispute over the existence of the state of Israel.  Political and religious leaders in both Israel and many Islamic countries whip this up as means of diverting attention from their own failures and to keep themselves in power. Historically, jews and muslims lived together (in Spain, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire, for example) without problems.  Christians expelled both the jews and muslims from Spain and Portugal, launched pogroms against jews in europe, and launched crusades against muslims.    Embed Quote
