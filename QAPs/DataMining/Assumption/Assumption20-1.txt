What are examples of assumptions that people passionately believe in when they are young, that turn out to be false?
That our thoughts are motivated by logic and not emotion.   That there is some balancing force in the universe; justice, which rewards those who commit righteous acts and punishes those who do evil; and that this force favors the righteous.   That the concepts 'good' and 'evil' are inherently real forces in the universe.   That moral matters are usually black and white (instead of all a shade of grey).   That there is an inherent purpose to life.   That one must always act in accordance with this purpose.   That one can't be happy or secure in a purposeless world.   That reproduction is a requisite condition to living a fulfilled life.   That the purpose of higher education is to secure a job.   That racism is over.   That looks don't matter as much as inner qualities.   That intelligent people didn't have to work extraordinarily hard and sacrifice opportunities to achieve their level of intelligence.   That levels of pleasure and entertainment are reliable indicators of a "good" life.   That social norms are necessarily true.   That an adult's judgments are always better than those of a child. That there is no association, whatsoever, between painful experiences and personal growth, and that painful experiences are to be avoided at all costs.   That loving someone more than life itself means that person will love you back, even a little bit.    Embed Quote Updated 7 Dec. 1,111 views.
