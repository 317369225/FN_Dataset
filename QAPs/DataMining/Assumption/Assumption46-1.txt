Question That Contains Assumptions: Is a mass conversion to Islam taking place in India?
Not that I don't love a good "Look, the Moslems are coming!" hysteria, but there is no evidence to support that claim. There is, on the other hand every piece of evidence that suggests that Muslims are systemically and in many cases physically harassed by our right wing Hindu hardliners.    Embed Quote
