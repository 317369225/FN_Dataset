How do I stop making assumptions?
Your presumptions deprive you of being curious and also know the matter with an open mind for such assumptions colour your judgement. So, what to do? The cure lies in your psyche: why do you assume before hand? You want to be right and say later 'ah, I knew it!' or you are afraid to face reality and so assume what you want to happen pacify the anxious mind? Once you know the real answer to it, you will automatically stop assuming and start welcoming the new and the unexpected into your life.    Embed Quote
