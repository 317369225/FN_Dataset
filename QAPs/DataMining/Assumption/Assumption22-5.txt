Question That Contains Assumptions: Why are Iranians so good-looking?
Subjective speaking, I think Iranians are good looking. They are into finer things in life, and therefore do have a ontaking of modern fashion. But very few do I see have a true sense of independent style. We don't do thrift shops, we do Diesel (not myself) and are attracted to the prestigious brands marketed on the western media. There's a reply down on this thread that points out nose jobs and hair transplant, and how they are a common commodity amongst persians. This is true, and I think we're better off without it because that attractive quality that Persians have is not tied into looks as it is to the middle easter charm (habibi). My Russian friends told me that Persians have hot blood, and I think this is what makes us attractive. You come to our home, we are hospitable. We work with you, it's easy to laugh with us and work on a good foot, but if you're buying from us or we are buying from you we will always bargain you out of your mind.    Embed Quote
