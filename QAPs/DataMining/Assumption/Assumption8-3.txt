★Behavioral Economics: What are the most controversial assumptions of economics?
I agree with Alex that "economists have a difficult time with ideas like culture and identity because they feel they need to interpret these in terms of wealth maximization or more basic desires". I would, however, qualify it to *some* economists. As Sylvia wrote, "Can you get 80% of the answer with unrealistic assumptions"? Clearly, our models of self interested, rational players (and if one wants to push assumptions, add common knowledge of rationality AND rational expectations), are naive caricatures of reality, which are meant to provide frameworks that constrain us to be honest about our analysis: which assumptions drive which results, and how can we take these to data. That these naive models seem to explain quite a lot of observed activity is a victory of economics. The assumption of self-interested agents is not, therefore, and should not be considered controversial. It is the analysis of those economists who are trying to explain EVERYTHING through that lens that should be scrutinized as inappropriate. Some things, like religion, identity and culture, may be best left for other disciplinary approaches.    Embed Quote
