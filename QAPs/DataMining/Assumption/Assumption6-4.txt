Does mathematics really exist in the universe or is it just a human assumption?
I'll get nitpicky about definitions to answer this. 1. Mathematics itself is a social construct. [math/9404236] On proof and progress in mathematics 2. If the results of it are correct then mathematical results will "govern" the universe in the same sense that any tautology does. However to say "logic controls" the universe can mislead. It's not like an agent is stopping another agent from doing something. It's saying "truths are true" or "facts are facts". This is why God can't make 2+2=5 even if God is omnipotent. (under the usual definitions of 2,+,=,5) "Power" and "agency" and "control" are not involved in definitions being what they are. When you see something like locusts that reproduce in prime numbers of years (e.g, 17-year locusts) — that's just tautology (17 can't be factored) interfacing with the logic of evolution and competition.    Embed Quote Updated 8 Feb, 2014. 686 views.
