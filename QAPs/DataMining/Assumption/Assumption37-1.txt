Do you assume that an assumption is a wrong act?
Are you asking if you are assuming right? From Comments: Even assumption assumes it is an assumption. We only know what we think we know. One is always assuming, no? We can only base our decisions to the best of our knowing and knowing fully well, that it is the best we can do given what we think we know. Simply said we can't be certain of anything - we simply do our best. Wrong may be too strong of a term. It may not pan out the way we expected, but hey we are un/learning. We can however be aware of our assumptions and again... the best we can. Thanks Quora User    Embed Quote
