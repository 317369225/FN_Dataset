Does law have a basic assumption that there is a God?
Your hypothesis is 180 degrees wrong as it applies to American law.  American law not only does not assume the existence of a God, but in fundamental ways consistently makes clear that the law and religion must be kept separate.  Here are some of these ways: The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion...".  Yes, the separation of religion and government are enshrined in our government's most basic formational document.  The United States Supreme Court, which is the ultimate arbiter of what the Constitution means, has held that this clause means, among other things, that... The federal, state and local governments cannot force public-school students to pray. Engel v. Vitale (1962). Nor can a teacher in a public school even read a prayer to students. Abington Township v. Schempp (1963). And in case anybody still has doubts about prayer in school, a school cannot make students observe a moment of silence to pray. Wallace v. Jaffree (1985). A city government cannot promote religion by placing religious symbols -- for example, a Christian nativity scene or the Ten Commandments -- on public property. Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh ACLU (1989), Glassroth v. Moore (M.D. Ala. 2002). Courts, when hearing testimony by U.S. citizens in civil and criminal cases, cannot force them to swear on the Bible or any other religious text (contrary to popular belief).  Federal law, like every state law, provides that any person may simply make a secular "affirmation" that their testimony is truthful. I'm afraid America's founders rejected your hypothesis at the time of founding, and the Supreme Court, Congress and state legislatures have repeatedly rejected it through the centuries since.    Embed Quote
