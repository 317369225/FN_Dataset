How do I stop making assumptions?
The question is, why should you stop making assumptions? Make assumptions, good or bad. Added to that, try drawing possible and probable consequences of your assumptions. That would actually help you in getting a clarity. But, remember, these are only possible assumptions and their consequences. In case, your assumptions and their respective consequences turn out to be true, you win. Else, you learn.    Embed Quote
