★Is it a safe assumption to say that human history would be less violent without religion?
Human beings are inherently violent and we were that way for a long time before we had the concept of religion. Wars almost always have territorial intentions and it makes sense given how animals often fight to maintain their dominance over a territory. Wars result out of the "us vs. them" mentality and human beings will always find a way to differentiate "us" and "them". We fight for differences in economic views (Communism vs. Capitalism), differences in wealth levels (class warfare, revolutions), differences in skin color (racism, slavery), linguistic differences, territorial differences and sometimes even difference in allegiance to a sporting team (soccer matches can sometimes end up in violence).    Embed Quote
