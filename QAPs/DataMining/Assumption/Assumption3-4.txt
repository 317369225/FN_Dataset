What is the most ridiculous assumption that is generally regarded as true?
That the enemy of my enemy is my friend. History is full of counterexamples, such as Saddam Hussein's Iraq and Iran in the era of the Ayatollahs. They were bitter enemies of one another at the same time both were antagonists of the United States.    Embed Quote
