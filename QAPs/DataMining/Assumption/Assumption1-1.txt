★Is it a safe assumption to say that human history would be less violent without religion?
Religiousness: Map showing relative importance of religion by country. Based on a 2006–2008 worldwide survey by Gallup. Violence: Estimates of disability adjusted life years from physical violence, per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. "Mortality and Burden of Disease Estimates for WHO Member States in 2002". World Health Organization. 2004. EDIT: Now for a more serious answer: it's quite safe to say that violence overall has been on the decline (Pinker). And as for the last century, we can also say that religion has been on the decline. But it might not be very meaningful to query the "religiousness" of a pre-industrial age, since one would assume that the vast majority would be following one form of religion or another. For example, the non-religious did exist even in Roman times, but they were the extreme outliers. Therefore, rather than considering it a causal factor, I view religiousness as a "surface phenomenon" (similar to the view of Marxist historical materialism), that it's a by-product or natural result of poverty, suffering and ignorance. And since the life expectancy, infant mortality rate, literacy rate etc. were simply extremely shocking centuries before, it's rather safe to presume the masses back then followed one set of superstitions or another. It's not that meaningful to hypothesise the experimental question: were this phenomenon removed, whether some other aspects of human development would improve -- since they are pretty much both caused by underlying economic and then social conditions.    Embed Quote
