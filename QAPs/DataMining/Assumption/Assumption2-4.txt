★What were your misconceptions as a kid?
I can't remember how old I was but I remember the moment. It was during the war in Rhodesia. I think I was around six years old. There were always reports about how many people had been killed or wounded. My mother used to come home from the Andrew Fleming Hospital and tell us who had come in, eventually including several of my cousins and my future step father (she met him when he was recuperating from a shot through the leg). Often she would not want to talk because of the young chaps who had died on her watch as a nurse in surgery, Anyway, I was watching a story on television. An old man was dying. I asked my sister why he was dying. "Old age", she replied. I didn't understand. She had to explain to me that people could die of disease or old age as well as from land-mines, bullets, booby-traps, being shot down out of the sky and so on, all of which I knew all about. In my little world people only died by being shot or blown up.    Embed Quote
