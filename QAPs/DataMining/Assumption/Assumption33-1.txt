Question That Contains Assumptions: Why are Chinese women so beautiful?
I think that by western aesthetic standards,  in general Asian people have "finer" physical appearances, i.e. our nose, eyes, hairs, voice, even body etc on average look slimmer, lighter and more "delicate" than a lot other races. Delicacy is usually considered a  feminine feature, so Asian women may look more attractive with these physical traits. Bad luck for us males. China has a large and diverse population, so of all the beautiful Asian women you see, a significant portion will naturally be Chinese.    Embed Quote Updated 5 Feb. 1,930 views.
