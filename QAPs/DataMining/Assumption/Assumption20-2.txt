What are examples of assumptions that people passionately believe in when they are young, that turn out to be false?
I used to believe that things reported on TV or in newspapers were true. I don't know about big news stories. I've never been to a war zone or taken part in international diplomacy or anything like that, so I don't have a direct basis to make judgements on that kind of reporting. But my experience of news reporting about things I have direct experience of is that it's only loosely based on the truth, if at all. Eg. one time I did some work for a company in the US. This was reported in an Australian newspaper as having been carried out in Australia. As a result I was later accused of being a liar when trying to take credit for my own work! One time a company I'd left continued to 'quote' me in press releases 2 years after I'd left. No fact checking by journalists who simply published 'me' verbatim. Journalists are largely just people selling any story they can to make the most money for the least work.    Embed Quote
