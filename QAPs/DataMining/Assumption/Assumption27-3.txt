How do I stop making assumptions?
Yo can never stop to hope ,because if you do that you will miss life.You need to be curious but give always a slower side to expectations.Always be ready  for a plan B in your life.Get ready to face those days where your wishes would be crushed but still don't give up.A day when your assumptions don't meet the reality you won't get that hurt and see a new dream.Finally a day would come when your assumption will intersect with you and that's the time you will wonder why i am not happy ? It's only because somewhere in the dream world you woke up and gave Page on up. So always assume but from both sides,the success and the failure of your assumptions.    Embed Quote
