If mathematics is an exact science, why are there assumptions?
The term exact science was in popular use a century ago but isn't very commonly used anymore.  It was used to describe those branches of knowledge which had precise mathematical formulas, and it included mathematics, physics, and chemistry.  It excluded sciences where the analysis and predictions were probabilistic rather than deterministic.  Exact science referred to the theoretical aspects of knowledge rather than the experimental aspects.  Anyone who has ever done an experiment in physics knows that the results are anything but precise.  In all theoretical knowledge there are assumptions to the theory.  The importance and validity of the theory depends on its predictions and how well those predictions correlate to actual observations. We could still use the term exact science, and if we did, we would apply it to parts of many other branches of knowledge than those mentioned above.  It's not a good idea, however, to hold on to the distinction between exact and inexact sciences since a probabilistic model can often be a better model than a deterministic one.  The advances in probability, statistics, and computer science during the 20th century make probabilistic models ideal for the the investigation of many questions, including those in physics.    Embed Quote
