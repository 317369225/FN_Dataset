Do you assume that an assumption is a wrong act?
No, assumptions can lead to figuring things out that couls not be deduced without assumptions. When making assumptions, you are always introducing potential error. The error factor will increase quickly as time increases. Before long the possible error is more than what its worth. I use multiple assumptions at the same time as a way to logicaly eliminate possible outcomes. This is a common outcome when you are stuck on something. Make two assumptions and see where that leads, then make the opposite assumptions and see where tjat leads. Many times both outcomes will eliminate an obstacle. Once thats removed you can make choices like normal.    Embed Quote
