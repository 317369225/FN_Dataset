★Behavioral Economics: What are the most controversial assumptions of economics?
That economics is a science. In science proper, you develop a hypothesis and conduct an experiment using a control group. You cannot do that in economics. At best, you can make and compare observations and approximate a control group. To clarify: that is not to say that economics cannot be scientifically pursued; rather that economists have a unique challenges when seeking answers. These challenges make answers very difficult to come by, and make certainty very rare. This challenge is acknowledged among practitioners, and has even caused some to dub economics a "pseudo-science" (e.g. Nassim Taleb). That seems a bit far, but the fact that we are trying to model something as finicky as human behavior certainly creates some challenges.    Embed Quote
