If mathematics is an exact science, why are there assumptions?
Christian is on point.  In order to engage in any sort of reasoned discourse, axioms are needed.  This is as true for maths as it is for linguistics (if you read any model theory, closer to maths in theory than you might think), philosophy, physics, chemistry... There are basic rules that are required, and these must be agreed to before the discussion begins.    Embed Quote
