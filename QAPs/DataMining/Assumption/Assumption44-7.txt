Occam's Razor - Which is simpler (fewest assumptions), atheism or theism? Why or why not?
Atheism has fewer assumptions because atheists say they don't know anything until they have eliminated all assumptions, while theist will convince themselves using all kinds of assumptions, and then there is God whose mysterious ways we will never understand as a fall back.    Embed Quote Updated 15 Oct, 2014. 61 views.
