Why is it bad to ask questions that contain assumptions?
Assumptions aren't the problem. False (misleading, inaccurate, or exaggerated) assumptions are. When people say, "Hey, that question contains an assumption!", they usually mean that it contains an assumption that's false or, at best, is highly debatable. Remember that virtually every question contains assumptions. For example, a question like How do you explain autism to a child? assumes that autism exists, that children exist, and (arguably) that you can or should explain autism to a child. False assumptions, however, solicit inaccurate information. Many people won't challenge the assumption and will just take it as a given. And, even if they do question the assumption, they'll still likely be biased to conclude that the assumption is true. Inaccurate answers aren't helpful. Since questions with false assumptions lead to inaccurate answers, questions with false assumptions are bad.    Embed Quote
