Question with assumptions:  Why do Jews and Muslims hate each other?
The vast majority on both sides do not hate each other. There are problems between Israelis and Palestinians, and some very ignorant parties on both sides. There are problems where the military industrial complex and the right wings on each sides promote anger with propaganda.  There are agendas that are enhanced by promoting this propaganda to create anger.    Embed Quote
