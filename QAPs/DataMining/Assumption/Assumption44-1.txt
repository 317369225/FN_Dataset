Occam's Razor - Which is simpler (fewest assumptions), atheism or theism? Why or why not?
Atheism is the lack of making any assumptions. Theism is the construction of what on the surface is a simple answer to complex questions, is actually unnecessarily complex. Yes, it is just one magical being instead of the complex interaction of forces and sub-atomic particles crossing universes, but it is a MAGICAL being. A Magical sentient, all-knowing, all-powerful, all-everything all of an all encompassing being that exists outside time and space as well as permeating all of time and space. That is just about as complex as any concept can be, so is sliced off in favor of simple little particles.    Embed Quote
