★What is the most bizarre assumption made about atheists?
That atheists hate god. http://www.quora.com/Religion/Wh... For those keeping score at home: Atheists have no belief in any god or gods. One cannot hate what one does not believe in. One can, of course have very strong negative feelings toward those who keep insisting that one should believe in what one does not believe in. And this atheist is far from fond of most religions and very close to a feeling of hate for obnoxious American Christianity,    Embed Quote Updated 11 Nov, 2012. 1,835 views.
