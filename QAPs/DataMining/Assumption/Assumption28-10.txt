Question That Contains Assumptions: How do atheists explain exorcisms?
" In 2003, an autistic 8-year-old boy in Milwaukee, Wis., was killed during an exorcism by church members who blamed an invading demon for his disability; in 2005 a young nun in Romania died at the hands of a priest during an exorcism after being bound to a cross, gagged, and left for days without food or water in an effort to expel demons. And on Christmas Day 2010 in London, England, a 14-year-old boy named Kristy Bamu was beaten and drowned to death by relatives trying to exorcise an evil spirit from the boy." (Benjamin Radford writing for LiveScience) Exorcisms only seem to be carried out on the religious... for some reason, these demons seem to prefer to possess the devout rather than the atheist...strange, don't you think? Religion is already dangerous enough, it is an infestation upon society, and infects our childrens minds... and yet the religious seem to want to make it even worse. So, what do I think of exorcisms? They are a dangerous, sometimes lethal, method of discounting medical treatments and science, for the gullible, the stupid and the corrupt.    Embed Quote
