Question That Contains Assumptions: Is a mass conversion to Islam taking place in India?
The only thing that is happening is that percentage of Muslim population is on rise. It can be statistically verified. The majority view is that it is because of lack of apparent family planning among majority muslims. It is not uncommon for poor muslim families to have as many as 5-6 children even today. The data available on conversion is quite limited.    Embed Quote
