★What were your misconceptions as a kid?
That the black core of pencils (called the lead) was actually made from the element Lead (Pb). My elder sister (cousin) even managed to convince me at one point that I was going to die of Lead poisoning for nibbling on the sharpened end of a pencil. It was too late for revenge by the time I realized they were made of graphite.    Embed Quote
