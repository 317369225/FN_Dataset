Economics: What are the most significant flawed assumptions in economics?
A couple major myths about economics come to mind. That human whim scaled up to a major nation is generally predictable. That scarcity can be eliminated by the right economic policy. That happiness or well-being are created by economic prosperity. These are myths that laymen have about economics, and which economists generally recognize and understand to be false (or only true in very limited circumstances).    Embed Quote Updated 3 Dec. 424 views.
