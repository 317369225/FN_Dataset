What is the biggest assumption people make about you that is not true?
That I am younger by about 5-10yrs than my real age and that I don't have a kid yet.  I am lucky to have good genes.  I eat sinfully but don't put on weight as much as other people.  I don't exercise much and don't make much effort but somehow I manage to still look attractive.  Lucky.  I have yet to earn it and I should start making an effort, it won't last forever if I don't.    Embed Quote
