What are the base assumptions of statistics?
This is a very hard question to answer without getting into formal epistemologies and the like because almost everything you would think is a base assumption is actually just an assumption of the simple models that we teach in introductory statistics classes.  We don't require that the data be independent or normally distributed, but the models we use in those situations have to depend on the specific form of the relevant dependencies or distributions. I'll have to think about what actually qualifies as a base assumption, but I suspect that it's going to come down to philosophy rather than actual statistics.    Embed Quote
