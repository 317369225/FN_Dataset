★What are the debates in the US today that will seem like assumptions within the next 100 years?
Marriage Rights for gay people. (I didn't get straight married or straight drive my car.) http://www.theonion.com/articles... Debating whether climate change was man made. Whether it's man made or not, it's upon us. It will be irrelevant when I have Ocean Front property in Colorado. Drug Legalization and Prison Reform. People will be shocked that we imprisoned drug users, rather than treat them. Discrimination against atheists. I expect us to have a Atheist Senator at least once in the next 100 years. Maybe a president in 300. The debate over Stem Cells. "Wait. They banned the most important scientific tool of the millennium?" There were Democratic and Republican parties? Those sound awful. I'm so glad we moved away from the two party system and ratified a constitutional amendment revoking corporate speech in elections. The Progressive Party, the Moderate Party, The Tea Party, and the Freedom Party are so much more fun sounding.    Embed Quote
