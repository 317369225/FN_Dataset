Questions with assumptions: Why is science immune from criticism, despite constantly changing answers?
Science isn't a thing.  Science is a process of discovery, observation, analysis, testing and evaluating information with an eye to explaining the universe around us.  Science isn't a hive entity or a single person or even some "thing" that you can lump into a category.  Just as important, any scientific endeavor or process is clearly open to criticism, "peer review" is precisely that "thing" you speak of.  Every assertion made by "science" is constantly evaluated, tested and rejected by the larger community.  I feel like what you're getting at is "layman" criticism and most of that is the clumsy biased or religious kind.  That is, big industrial conglomerates don't like environmental protection laws, so they pay people to campaign against those.  Religious people don't like evolution and cosmology, so they obsess about it and try to find "bias confirming" critiques to support their end game.  But the "constantly changing" part isn't just some random process whereby people casually change something, but where that which was in the area of ambiguity is cleared up.  That "clearing up" tends to appear as arbitrary change to the general public who obsesses over absolutes and unchanging things as a place of comfort in a universe of considerable change and ambiguity.    Embed Quote Updated 8 Feb. 5,210 views.
