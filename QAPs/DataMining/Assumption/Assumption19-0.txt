★If Quora does not allow Question That Contains Assumptions, then why does it permit this topic to be added to questions based on assumptions about the validity of their premises?
Based on some conversations I've had with some admins, my takeaway is that this topic is grandfathered in. In other words, it isn't a great topic, but because the topic already has so much activity, there isn't enough momentum to get rid of it...yet. I know some admins do not like this topic and would not allow this topic or certain other subjective topics if they were added today. I used to defend this topic. In general, as I gain more experience, it's always shocking to me how my views become increasingly aligned with those on the site who have more experience. Admins know what they're doing :) The problem with this topic is that it creates an atmosphere of normalcy on Quora where it seems OK to ask assumption-laden questions, and I believe that detracts from overall site quality. In fact this topic even promotes assumption laden questions because it has so many subscribers. I'm sure this is an issue that admins will continue to talk about, but currently the topic still exists and continues to be used. The QTCA topic has been cleaned up a lot, thanks to work by John H. Hillman, V and others. In general I think the site is stronger when some questions are reworded to remove assumptions. Here are two resources worth noting: Should questions on Quora contain assumptions? Should questions on Quora be phrased neutrally? especially Greg Price's answer and secondarily my answer.    Embed Quote Updated 16 Jun, 2012. 715 views.
