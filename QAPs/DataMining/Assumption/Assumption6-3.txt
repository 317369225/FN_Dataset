Does mathematics really exist in the universe or is it just a human assumption?
Mathematics exists at the same level as languages exist; they are used to describe things, events and relations in proportion to each other. It's just a language of special, although vast purpose, nothing else. Does not fit to write prose, but fits to write physics or algorithms for example. If there is an alien race which speaks same mathematics as we have, that would prove it as universal language. Would be great for communication, although not likely as their brains would likely be wired differently and they might have completely different mathematics than ours.    Embed Quote
