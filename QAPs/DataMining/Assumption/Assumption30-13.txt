What are some examples of stupid assumptions that intelligent people often make?
Many good answers given, but also: The Socratic Fallacy: The belief that if you understand something, you can clearly explain it. (A good counter-example - I cannot describe what arsenic does when consumed, but I know that consuming it is a bad idea). The belief that morons are always wrong: Just because a stupid person believes something, doesn't make the belief stupid. As an example, stupid people believe that they should eat, drink and breathe. These remain good ideas, no matter how many stupid people believe them.    Embed Quote
