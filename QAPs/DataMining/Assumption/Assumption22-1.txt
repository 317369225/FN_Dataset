Question That Contains Assumptions: Why are Iranians so good-looking?
Many Iranians are good looking (my handsome husband is one). The women are stunning. Many good points have been made by previous posts but one BIG piece of the puzzle is missing.........plastic surgery!!! I remember making the same remark about how pretty all of the girls were on some of his news feed on Facebook and he replied "of course they are all pretty, they've all had plastic surgery and are wearing so much makeup". (My husband has spent 30 of his 32 years living in Iran) You cannot argue with the fact that Iranians are good looking BUT it's not entirely fair to just say that they are just ridiculously lucky and have amazingly good looking perfectly proportioned features while the rest of the Middle East looks more 'ethnic'   "The Islamic republic has the highest rate of nose surgery in the world, although precise figures are hard to establish. In recent years other forms of cosmetic enhancement, including chin operations, finger nail implants, embedding fake diamonds in the gums and tattooed eyebrows, have also become popular, but the nose job remains the most in-demand. Iranians refer to the perfectly formed button nose it is meant to achieve as the 'one million toman (£590) nose'. In fact, the going rate ranges from much less than that to about £2,600." http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&s...    Embed Quote
