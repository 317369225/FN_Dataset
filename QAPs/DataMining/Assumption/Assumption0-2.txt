★What is an assumption that people often wrongly make?
That other people hold the same understanding as them. This is a common mistake made by young children. I remember reading about a study in which a child is placed in the same room as an adult, with a shelf and a desk. Then the experimenter hides a ball inside the shelf. The child then watches the adult leave the room, and afterward the experimenter takes out the ball and hides it in the desk instead. When asked where the ball is, the child correctly responds "in the desk." But then the adult comes back, and when the child is asked "Where does [adult] think the ball is?" the child still responds "in the desk." The child fails to understand that his/her knowledge is not universal knowledge. Sounds really simple, right? Yet adults do it all the time too. So many arguments I've seen have boiled down to a simple misunderstanding between two people where they used the same word to mean two different things. Or maybe one person considers some issue especially significant because of her background, while the other doesn't feel the same way and makes a joke about it that accidentally offends her. If we just took a moment to step back and clear up with each other where our misunderstandings stemmed from, so many arguments could be avoided. And maybe a few wars too, while we're at it. [Unfortunately I can't find the original source of the study. If you can find it, let me know!]    Embed Quote
