★Is it a safe assumption to say that human history would be less violent without religion?
There is no definitive answer to this question because all things are not equal. Would history be less violent without religion? - well yes, because people have been slaughtered in the name of religion. Would we have found something else to bicker over in the absence of religion? Yes again, because we already do and have (such as resources and territory) But we can never know what history and current events would be if religion never existed because it does. And more importantly, for those comparing the sheer volume of death associated with religious conflict and non-religious conflict, you can not do that simply because of available technologies and the scale of human population. For example, what would have happened had the crusades taken place on a 6 billion populated globe, with weaponry available in World War II?    Embed Quote
