What are basic assumptions of modern physics?
Causality is regarded as an axiom in physics. It's the idea that A causes B. It implies that each frame of time is connected to the next; that moments in time are not independent of each other. Forces cause a body to accelerate. The force is the cause, and the acceleration is the effect. A cause must precede its effect in all reference frames even in curved spacetime. Causality (physics) Regarding quantum mechanics, causality gets more complex, but causality seems to dominate here as well. I found this interesting post on Reddit that seems to be a nice summary: Does quantum mechanics violate causality?
