Question with assumptions:  Why do Jews and Muslims hate each other?
Jews don't hate Muslims. Israelis don't hate Muslims. There are many Muslim citizens of Israel and they have absolute freedom to worship, as do Christians and Baha'is,both of whom suffer persecution in many, if not most, Muslim countries. It's Muslims that hate Jews, because it's an affront to their faith and world-view that a Jewish, or for that matter any non-Muslim, state should exist in the Middle East. This view is clearly expressed in many of the answers here. Just compare the Israeli media and the medias of most Arab countries. Mainstream Arab media is filled with the sort of antiSemitic articles and cartoons that have been banned in Europe since WW2, material that for the most part draws no distinction between Jews and Israel. In Israeli media, you'll find no such thing.    Embed Quote
