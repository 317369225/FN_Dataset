★What is an assumption that people often wrongly make?
That one should always have an opinion on something. People are too often viewed as being apathetic or ignorant if they cannot express how they feel about an issue when, in fact, they might understand that issue more fully than the more passionate person but realize that no firm conclusions can be drawn based on the information at hand.    Embed Quote
