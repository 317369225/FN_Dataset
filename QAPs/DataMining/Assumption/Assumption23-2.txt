Economics: What are the most significant flawed assumptions in economics?
I would say that the vast majority of economists don't have an issue with this, but the basic economics theory of perfect equilibrium relies on the assumption of perfect information in the market.  You'll often hear politicians discuss economics in a very Economics 101 way, and they will cite economic theories as if everything would be perfect if everyone just stopped meddling.  I'm not making a big or small market argument here, but those politicians who are most doctrinaire about the free market tend to act as if government regulation is the only thing standing between us and perfect equilibrium.    Embed Quote
