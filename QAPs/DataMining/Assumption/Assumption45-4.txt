Question That Contains Assumptions: Why are 99% of successful people married?
In my opinion, it's a matter of how one defines success. I was unhappily married to a man back in the early nineties, it lasted less than two years. Had I discovered the cure for Cancer during that two year span, (by tripping over a box of research, it wouldn't happen any other way) I would have been just as miserable. Being happily married, or happily single, or just happy in general is success. Freud defined, uh, a fully autonomous person (?) As one who is able to work, love, and play. I think I mangled that pretty badly, but I agree with the basic premise, that a successful life is not going to mean the same thing to everyone.    Embed Quote
