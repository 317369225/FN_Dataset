Does mathematics really exist in the universe or is it just a human assumption?
Relations between concepts don't need material expression to hold true. As they don't need material expression, they are not subjected to the passing of time. They don't decay. Existence (as a concept) is greater than material expression. It encompasses it, but also supersedes it. It really is as simple as that. Pythagoras theorem wasn't invented by Pythagoras. It existed "beforehand". Although "beforehand" is improper, as it gives a sense of time passing, for something that really is outside of time, that is, for something that is eternal. So, yes, Mathematics as a vast a beautiful set of relations really exist in the Universe, provided that your definition of Universe includes atemporal things, that is, is not restricted to the physical Universe, which is just a manifestation or avatar of eternal realities.    Embed Quote Updated 29 Jul, 2014. 173 views.
