★What is the great childhood assumption which gets a humongous shift after we mature or become old enough?
(Still technically a child, but jaded enough to pose an opinion.) I think there are many, but other than what Debatri Datta said, I'd add "believing that your parents know what they're doing." But more importantly, "believing that anything else would be bad." The idea that your parents don't have any idea what they're doing is scary. But it also helps you feel less alone, when you are lost and clueless. You have another imperfect person to turn to.    Embed Quote
