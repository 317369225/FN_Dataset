What are good assumptions about people?
Most people want to assume that they accurately observed, interpreted, understood, and remembered all of their experiences.  Most assume that their mentors were even more accurate then they themselves were.  That there is only one way of interpreting experiences is a horrible assumption which isolates thinkers and limit their understanding and wisdom.    Embed Quote
