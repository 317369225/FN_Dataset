If mathematics is an exact science, why are there assumptions?
Those axioms are only assumptions within the boundary of math. Physically I can easily prove them by experimentation. E.g, 1=1 is an axiom: I take an apple, put it in an empty box. I take out the apple The box is empty 0=0 is an axiom: I have an empty box I wait The box is still empty These ridiculously simple experiments prove that my axioms hold in the real world. Mathematically we can't prove those., because they don't rely on other theorems.    Embed Quote Updated 22 Nov. 398 views.
