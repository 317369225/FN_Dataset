★What is the most bizarre assumption made about atheists?
Atheists are devil worshipers. A typical atheist - I wish. If you give this any thought it's obviously completely illogical - if we worshiped the devil we would believe in a supernatural entity and we would not then be atheists. The slightly more sophisticated argument is that we are not literally worshiping the devil, but that it amounts to the same thing, the chain of 'logic' is: Atheists do not worship God. Everyone worships something. Atheists are therefore worshiping something other than God. Worshiping anything other than God is worshiping the devil. Point 2 is not necessarily true (and 4 is a matter of opinion not fact) and so the logic is invalid. I'm not saying all or even most Christians think this, but there are people out there who do.    Embed Quote Updated 16 Mar, 2013. 562 views.
