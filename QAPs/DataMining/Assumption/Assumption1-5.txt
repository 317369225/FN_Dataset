★Is it a safe assumption to say that human history would be less violent without religion?
I think it's safe to say that without *ideologies* that declare some people to be the enemy, human history would be less violent. Religion is one form of ideology that separates people into competing groups. Communism is another such ideology. And there are many others. In order to assume that history would be less violent without religion, one would have to assume that some other ideology that has the same function would not have taken its place. Simply saying "if everyone were atheist, there would be no wars or inhumane violence" is, of course, nonsense. The communist countries of the 20th Century showed that. Another ideology simply took the place of religion in that case. But yes, if you could remove religion (as historically practiced) and all *other* forms of ideologies that place themselves above humanity, history would have been far less violent. There would still be disagreements and squabbles about purely personal issues, but the driving forces that cause people to commit violence en masse would not be there.    Embed Quote
