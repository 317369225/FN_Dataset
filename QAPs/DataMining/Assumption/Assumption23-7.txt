Economics: What are the most significant flawed assumptions in economics?
I would consider the paradox of beta the biggest anomaly in finance. What recent research has shown is that contrary to what's supposed to happen, due to behavioral factors/constraints and leverage constraints, lower beta assets (across every single asset class) have outperformed higher beta assets over varying investment horizons over the last 50 years. Re: the beta paradox of finance, the key takeaway is from the first link below 2013:  "A basic premise of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is that all agents invest in the portfolio with the highest expected excess return per unit of risk (Sharpe ratio), and leverage or de-leverage this portfolio to suit their risk preferences. However, many investors—such as individuals, pension funds, and mutual funds — are constrained in the leverage that they can take, and they therefore overweight risky securities instead of using leverage." 2013: Page on nyu.edu 2010: Page on nyu.edu Malcolm Baker, Harvard finance professor, did a study, which also highlights this anomaly from a behavioral standpoint. In addition to the natural human or mandated bias towards short-term returns among retail investors and hedge fund investors, long-term investors like pension funds and mutual funds also have an incentive to avoid low-beta investments because of a mandate to beat a specific benchmark portfolio (typically a market-cap weighted index) and to minimize tracking error relative to that benchmark. These benchmarks give money managers a substantial disincentive to invest in low-beta or low-volatility stocks, even if they believe that these stocks have substantially positive alphas. The reason is that low-beta stocks, even when they have high expected alpha, will increase tracking error (since, by definition, they are uncorrelated to the index): 2012: Page on advisorperspectives.com 2014: Page on pionline.com    Embed Quote
