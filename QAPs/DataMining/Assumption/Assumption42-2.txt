Is the psychiatric assumption true that there are no bad people but only sick ones?
There is some truth to this, and we psychiatrists are trained to believe in our patients, to see the good and recognize the strengths. On the other hand, we are also trained to identify people who are not good, and have bad intentions and enjoy hurting other people. These are called psychopaths. They have biologically different wiring and respond to violence with pleasant arousal. This can be measured. The author to look up is Robert D. Hare. (in Canada somewhere).    Embed Quote
