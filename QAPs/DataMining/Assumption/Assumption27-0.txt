How do I stop making assumptions?
Curiosity is all about surprises. It's surprising to have an assumption be debunked. When this occurs, your curiosity should be strengthened, not weakened. As long as you guide your mindset to believe that a wrong assumption is a surprise rather than a miscalculation on your part, it should be relatively exciting to continue having assumptions. And actually, we all have assumptions about practically everything. Instead of trying to reduce your assumptions, just shift the way you think about them. When you approach something with certain prefixed ideas, be open to exploring how they might be wrong in case they don't hold up to reality. Don't focus so much on reducing something that's so natural to us. Just be ready to incorporate whatever you learn into your current judement system.    Embed Quote
