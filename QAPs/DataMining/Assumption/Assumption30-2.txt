What are some examples of stupid assumptions that intelligent people often make?
Hume is the classic on this.  Our vaunted rationality is in practice persistently weak and fallible.  Even the best minds err often and profoundly.  We unwittingly employ a number of concepts and methods that cannot strictly be justified.  Even basic principles of inference are matters of faith.  Better to give up the pretense and retire to the billiard parlor and the company of the fairer sex.  He does not deny that basic beliefs are necessary.  Indeed, we cannot forgo them, even if we try.  However, their ground must be sought elsewhere than in observation and logic, viz., in the passions. Thus, if this is right, a common error of the philosophically untutored, and even of the so schooled in their normal, unreflective moments, is to too quickly discount emotion and intuition as sources of conviction and guides to action.    Embed Quote
