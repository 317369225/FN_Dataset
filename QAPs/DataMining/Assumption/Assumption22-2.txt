Question That Contains Assumptions: Why are Iranians so good-looking?
If you don't live in Iran, the honest answer is that there are powerful selection processes governing which pictures of which Iranians are available to your eye.  I invite you to fly to Teheran and walk around for a couple of days, looking at random everyday Iranians, and then tell me if you still think Iranians, as a group, are so good-looking.    Embed Quote
