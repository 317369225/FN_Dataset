★Behavioral Economics: What are the most controversial assumptions of economics?
I think Alex Tabarrok's answer is exactly right from a theory perspective. Another aspect is empirics: in mainstream microeconomics, empirical work that can't make a pretty strong claim of being causal is given very little weight. The other social sciences are far more comfortable with descriptive and qualitative work. Although I can appreciate the economics perspective (and basically follow it in my own work), this position does hinder collaboration across the social sciences, which is unfortunate.    Embed Quote
