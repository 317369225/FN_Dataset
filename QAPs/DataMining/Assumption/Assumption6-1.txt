Does mathematics really exist in the universe or is it just a human assumption?
"How much does your love weigh?" "Can I have some red for breakfast?" "Do I look fat in this number 42?"" Abstract concepts of any kind - whether the concept of love or the color red or the number 42 - have a different kind of existence than material objects. This is a question that has been discussed widely throughout the world for many years and it's a great question to ponder. The word "exist" has too many definitions, so to make any progress on this question you need to re-phrase the question to clarify what kind of existence you mean.  For example, you could ask: "Does mathematics have mass or energy or can it otherwise be detected by scientists?" Or you could ask: "Do abstract concepts like mathematics, love, and colors have a type of existence that is different from matter and energy?"    Embed Quote
