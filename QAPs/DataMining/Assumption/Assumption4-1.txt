★What is the most bizarre assumption made about atheists?
That atheists "know" more than god. (hint, we don't believe in your deity, so a comparison is a logical fallacy . . . well, I guess we do know more, since we know more than an imaginary creature) That all atheists secretly believe in god (and conveniently, it's always "your" god . . . just in denial). That all atheists hate chocolate (for the record, I love chocolate). That you can say things like, "You're going to hell!" and have it matter anymore to an atheist any more than a person of another faith (i.e. a Muslim to a Christian) telling you that you're going to his/her version of hell. That all atheists are liberal. That all atheists are amazing in bed. (guilty!)    Embed Quote
