★Is it a safe assumption to say that human history would be less violent without religion?
The problem with this statement is Pol Pot and Stalin are trotted out as atheists to claim that religion is less violent than the alternative. Pol Pot and Stalin were both inflexible ideologues, and religion is a subset of all types of ideology, divine or secular. Ideologies are defined by the concept that their ideas are right and immutable (ideal), and they often have a written text that is sacrosanct and not amended, such as the Bible, Torah, Koran, Little Red Book, Green Book etc. On the other hand, not all atheists are dogmatic ideologues like Pol Pot. In fact most atheists are opposed to religion precisely because it is inflexible and does not adapt to wonderful new ideas about the size and age of the universe or how life evolved within it. I would argue that an atheist (a non believer) who 'believes' in the sanctity of a political belief system like Stalinism is not really an atheist by definition. Non-fixed ideological systems like science, where new evidence can change core tenets or a constitution which can be amended or a government with different policy be elected democratically, tend to allow for consensus to be achieved where an original belief is challenged and are less violent because they can adapt and change. Human history would be less violent without ideology, which includes religion.    Embed Quote
