What are some examples of stupid assumptions that intelligent people often make?
Assuming that a powerful intellect equals intelligence. Perhaps intelligence is how we use the knowledge we have, and the ability to see when we need to seek more. And emotional intelligence? In many situations it is this, and not a stream of facts or rational argument that allows resolution. In other situations factual rationality added to emotional intelligence is best. Intelligence may be more the application of knowledge to a situation, and the ability to adapt, rather than the amount of knowledge a person can accumulate and repeat.    Embed Quote
