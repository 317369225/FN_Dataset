★What is the most bizarre assumption made about atheists?
That ... Atheists are arrogant pricks. Atheists are as fundamentalist as religious people can be. Atheists lead a life that is without purpose and meaning. Atheists lack a source of morality. Atheists have to explain the universe around them: it's origin and purpose.    Embed Quote Updated 8 Mar, 2014. 1,432 views.
