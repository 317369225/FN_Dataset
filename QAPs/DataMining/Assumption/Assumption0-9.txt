★What is an assumption that people often wrongly make?
That a question is a statement. For instance, if I respond to "We need to protect free speech" with "Why?" some people will assume I'm suggesting we don't need to protect free speech. It won't occur to them that I may just be gathering information—that I simply am curious about their reasoning. They expect their claim to be followed by some form of agreement or disagreement. It doesn't occur to them that someone might ask a neutral question. They have likely been in so many arguments about the subject, they simply assume everyone is going to take a side and that "questions" are weapons. I don't necessarily blame people for this stance, especially if they've been attacked in the past. But it's very hard to counteract their assumption. Sometimes it's impossible.    Embed Quote Updated 4 Dec, 2013. 46,441 views.
