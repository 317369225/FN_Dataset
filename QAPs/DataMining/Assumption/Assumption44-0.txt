Occam's Razor - Which is simpler (fewest assumptions), atheism or theism? Why or why not?
The most popular statement of Occam's Razor (and the best, in my opinion) is "entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity".  In other words, don't assume the existence of anything beyond what is necessary to explain your observations.   That's where the argument always comes in.  Just being simpler doesn't make an argument better, under Occam.  As Einstein said "make things as simple as possible, but no simpler".  A world in which air resistance didn't affect the flight of a cannonball might be simpler than one in which it does, but it doesn't adequately explain what we observe.   So, atheism is, in that sense, "simpler" than theism, because it assumes the existence of at least one fewer entity (and a pretty significant entity, at that).  The question, then, is if existence as you observe, experience and understand it can be adequately explained without the existence of a Supreme Being (or beings).  If you think so, then you're probably an atheist.  If not, then you probably at least suspect that there is a God.    Embed Quote
