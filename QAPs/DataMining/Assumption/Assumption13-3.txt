What are your base assumptions?
I assume that you're going to read this. At my age, I'm pretty sure that I exist because if I don't, I sure pity the person who's having all these aches and pains. I think tomorrow is going to be better than today, based on yesterday. I'm going to die. I don't think it's going to be tomorrow. That comforts me. I assume that all people are good until they show me they aren't.. I assume the sun is going to come up tomorrow and that the moon will continue to orbit the earth, even if gay marriage is passed by all 50 states in the union. I assume there is no God. If there is then I'll be pleasantly surprised, if there isn't, I'll just be worm food. And if there is, I'll just be worm food. I assume that none of the above is true. I assume that all of the above is true. I assume that that the difference between the two doesn't amount to a hill of beans, also known as  bulls--t.    Embed Quote Updated 27 Aug, 2013. 1,331 views.
