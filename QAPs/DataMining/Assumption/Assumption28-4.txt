Question That Contains Assumptions: How do atheists explain exorcisms?
Atheists are not a unitary group. The only commonality is lack of belief in a deity. From there everything varies. I am not an atheist, but I suspect I share a view with many atheists and many theists as well that exorcisms are generally desperate acts attempting to deal with the mentally ill (and at times not even mentally ill but just different from social norm) that ofttimes sink to abuse of those individuals.    Embed Quote
