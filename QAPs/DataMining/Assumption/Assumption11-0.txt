Questions with assumptions: Why is science immune from criticism, despite constantly changing answers?
Let's see: 1. Science is not immune for criticism 2. Science doesn't "constantly change answers" - it rarely changes them. 3. Science never changes facts, it sometimes changes theories or explanations of the facts 4. "Scientific fact" is a frequently used phrase, but it's really kind of nonsensical. A fact is not scientific or nonscientific. 5. I can't say why people assume science is correct. Science offers theories and explanations. In some fields, these theories are very strong and make very accurate predictions about verifiable events. In other fields, the theories are weaker and make less accurate predictions.  Indeed, even some of the older theories are very good: Newton's Laws work very well in pretty much all circumstances anyone is likely to run into. That's why they lasted so long.    Embed Quote
