Do all questions contain assumptions?
Yes. All of them do. The answers are sought to either dissolve them or strengthen them. Other answers talk about as related to Quora... I would consider a question as a troll, if I get the feeling that the underlying assumptions are already formed opinions in the questioner's mind and are seeking only to strengthen it.    Embed Quote
