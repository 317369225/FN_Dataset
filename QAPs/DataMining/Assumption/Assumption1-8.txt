★Is it a safe assumption to say that human history would be less violent without religion?
I think it would be more accurate to say that by and large wars are organized by the rich and powerful elite for their own political, economic and egotistical purposes; religion is the pitch they use to sell the prospect of killing and dying to the poor, insignificant underprivileged.    Embed Quote
