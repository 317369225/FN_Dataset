★What are the debates in the US today that will seem like assumptions within the next 100 years?
The logic of universal health coverage - which isn't the same as "single payer" healthcare - although it's often lumped together - typically to support a political agenda. We continue to debate this on economic principals - when it should really be debated on the merits of societal or moral/ethical principals. But I think the economic debate will largely dissolve over the next 50 - 100 years. Healthcare - like education - is a foundational benefit to any society or culture. It's also (often) the "bookend" to education - which is largely at the start of life. It's an investment in people - which should not be reduced to economic equations. I recently wrote a tribute to Dr. Arnold 'Bud' Relman who was Editor-in-Chief of the prestigious NEJM from 1977 to 1991 - and passed away last week. I ended the piece with his quote - from 1991. [1] Today's market-oriented, profit-driven health care industry therefore sends signals to physicians that are frustrating and profoundly disturbing to the majority of us who believe we are parties to a social contract, not a business contract. We are not vendors, and we are not merely free economic agents in a free market. Arnold S.
