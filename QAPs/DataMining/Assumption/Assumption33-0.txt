Question That Contains Assumptions: Why are Chinese women so beautiful?
I think weight is a big factor. I'm an American, and-- sad to say-- we are a nation of chubby checkers. When I came to China, I was like, "Yikes! Every 3rd or 4th girl is a total babe!" Of course, obesity is on the rise in China, but it's still FAR from as bad as in the States. Also, I think there's a certain amount of attraction to the "exotic." Slightly different skin tone, different eye shape, somewhat different features in general, all add to that "exotic" look for me (as a white guy), and I don't think I'm alone in that perception.    Embed Quote
