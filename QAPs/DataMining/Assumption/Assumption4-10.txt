★What is the most bizarre assumption made about atheists?
That atheists want to be called "pagans" (which is somehow a contraction of "pay again"). Is it acceptable to call an atheist, a pagan? Actually, the bizarrest assertion I've heard about atheism is that somebody who says such a thing can be tolerated on a site with a "Be Nice, Be Respectful" policy.    Embed Quote
