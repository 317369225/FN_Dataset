Does mathematics really exist in the universe or is it just a human assumption?
Mathematics exists as the words and the music exist. They exist inside of all of us, but there is not proof the the existence of them without us. The universe can do all its wonders without the help of a mathematician.  The "mechanic" of the universe only consists of very simple interactions between particles. These interactions does not need "mathematics nor logic" to be realized (unless you believe that the universe is a simulation running in a computer or in a mathematics mind).    Embed Quote
