Do all questions contain assumptions?
Perhaps if there is no assumption to be challenged, then there is no question to be asked. Many  questions arise because something on the mental map of reality does not fit. That map, especially the parts that are already inked in, are the things we assume to be true. The parts still in pencil, we are a little less confident about, but still work "as if" they are true. When something about our observations says that the map and reality don't agree, we ask questions. We may not ask the right questions, and we may scribble lines all over the map to try and make it fit, when the problem is in something we have already inked, (sort of like "retrograde motion" of the planets); but without our assumptions, our "working map" there would be no misalignments to notice. We would just be blissfully unaware. I would rather be wrong, and questioning, than detached.    Embed Quote
