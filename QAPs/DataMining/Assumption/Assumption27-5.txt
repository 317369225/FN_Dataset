How do I stop making assumptions?
First of all,  thanks for the a2a. Let's think this way. Have you seen anyone who doesn't assume anything ever. So what am I implying? The whole entire world runs on assumptions(some less,  some more)   until proven wrong. Some people also call them beliefs. Now the good thing about it is,  lot of people are OK if their assumptions go wrong. Actually most of them are curious to see if they are right or wrong. So curiosity doesn't die with assuming something. But it definitely does when you are not willing to accept facts, proven wrong and are resistant to change. So the more you are open to change, the easier it is to make  assumptions but it's difficult,  the more you are rigid, the more you fear facts, info, and kinda don't want someone to burst your bubble. Actually I am assuming that may be you are afraid to be wrong, think people will judge you or maybe hate the feeling of being wrong. See even I am assuming here. Let me know whether am right or wrong.    Embed Quote
