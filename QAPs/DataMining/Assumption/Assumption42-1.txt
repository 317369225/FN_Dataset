Is the psychiatric assumption true that there are no bad people but only sick ones?
In my opinion there really is no right answer to this question. Speaking from the ideas within psychology, I wouldn’t say there are truly any “bad people”. People absolutely may do horrible or even unthinkable things but I wouldn’t explain this because they are “bad”. Psychologists use the biopsychosocial model to explain why psychological disorders happen. This means that biological, psychological, and social aspects all collectively contribute to human behavior and disorders.  People who do horrible things may have a mental or personality disorder. For example, paraphilia (deviation involving the object of a person’s sexual attraction) Types are pedophilia, exhibitionism, fetishism, frotteurism, sadism, masochism, etc. The idea of a pedophile is disgusting to think about, but there has to be a reason why somebody would do something so horrible. Research shows that majority of these people were sexually abused as children. There ideas of appropriate sexual thoughts and behaviors are skewed at a young age and sets them up for wrongful thinking throughout life. People may define “bad people” as those who commit murders, crime, steal, cheat, lie, etc.  I do agree that behaviors such as these are bad, but I wouldn’t call the person necessarily bad. We start off innocent and naïve in the world. Genetics, life experiences, and many other things contribute to people’s “bad” behavior and choices. This is just one aspect of the many ways of answering this question.    Embed Quote
