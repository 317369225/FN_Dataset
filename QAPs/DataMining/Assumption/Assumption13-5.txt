What are your base assumptions?
This is a great question! I am small and in the grand scheme of things I do not matter. Therefore I should only invest in issues as long as I can manage the stress. The world is not fair, in fact the world has no sense of what fairness even is...it just is At the end of the day I am alone, I have to be able to look at myself in the mirror. I'd rather be honest and hurt some than lie to them People are animals like every other animal, placing our selves above other species only highlights our hubris...not greatness Most people are only looking out for themselves, their own needs, and will screw you to get there There is no "higher power" or spirit or other entities, just excuses to hide my insecurities. Knowledge is of the utmost importance, there is never enough Most of the important things in life are a journey; not a destination The journey of life is a marathon, not a race. I would rather experience a small number of things intimately than a great number of things superficially    Embed Quote
