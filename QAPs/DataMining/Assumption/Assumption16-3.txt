What is the biggest assumption people make about you that is not true?
I am overweight, poor, and introverted. This combination is often interpreted as unintelligent, uneducated, and / or antisocial. The truth is, I have a wide variety of experiences, am fairly well read, relatively current on world events, and am working on my doctorate. I am also painfully socially awkward - if there is a wrong thing to say in a situation, those words will often be the first I utter. So, I often keep my mouth closed, and listen. If I am comfortable, and feel I have something to contribute to the conversation, I will. There IS someone in here. Just not who you might expect.    Embed Quote
