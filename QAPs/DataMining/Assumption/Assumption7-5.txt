Do all questions contain assumptions?
This is something I find annoying about Quora. All questions contain assumptions, like word meanings and interpretation of language, models of the nature of the natural world, and expected actions on the part of the people being asked. When Quora labels a question as 'containing assumptions', they really mean 'loaded questions', which are a type of trolling.  For example, "Are you still beating your wife?", or "why are republicans so stupid?" .    Embed Quote
