What are your base assumptions?
To be happy with yourself to be happy with someone else Treat all people with respect until they give you a reason not to Have fun when you can and enjoy life because it will end someday If a relationship is worth it do what you need to, to apologize and repair them because relationships are worth a lot, and can get you to places you only hoped of, don't burn bridges Don't compare yourself to others, all paths may be different lengths, but all end up about six feet deep Do what you can to get past your demons Focus on what you can do today to make tomorrow better I hope that helps, those are a few things I try to live my life by and seems to make sense to me, and if I misunderstood what you meant let me know and I'll change this.    Embed Quote
