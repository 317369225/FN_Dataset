If mathematics is an exact science, why are there assumptions?
Firstly, assumptions aren't what most people presume they are. They are either axioms which are assumed to be true (often without proof, but a lot of the axioms we use have been proven true) or they are initial conditions that the [meta-]mathematical system is in before 'starting' whatever it is you want to do. For example, they assume that something is a member of a set, space, field, group, category, logic, perhaps with some 'rules' that hold before beginning a proof or in applied math, including derivative subjects such as physics and other hard sciences, the assumption is that the system starts in a particular state (i.e. they are the precondtions).  Hence, what this tells you is that if you find (or prove) that your problem is part of a class of problems with those particular preconditions, and there is a 'process' which takes you from those preconditions to some post condition(s) which hold(s), then you can solve any problem of that class [aka frame of reference which Christain Benesch and David Budd are referring to].    Embed Quote
