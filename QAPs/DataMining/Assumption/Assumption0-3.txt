★What is an assumption that people often wrongly make?
The Fundamental Attribution Error People often attribute the behavior of others to "personality" or inherent traits, while justifying their own behavior using situational context. For example, if you see a man on the side of the road kicking his car, you might assume that he has an "angry personality," while the man might justify his actions with the line of reasoning that anyone would be frustrated if their car broke down. Diffusion of Responsibility The assumption that others will take responsibility for something. Example: In a famous experiment by Darley and Latané (1968), subjects were placed alone in cubicles and told that there were either one or five subjects in adjacent, similarly isolated cubicles. Subjects were told that they were supposed to talk about social problems. During the experiment, subjects heard what sounded like one of the other subjects having a seizure. When they thought they were one of six subjects, only 31% of the subjects responded to calls for help. When they thought they were the only person other than the person having a seizure, 85% of the subjects responded.    Embed Quote
