Is it a common assumption that an atheist is immoral and depraved?
Not among rational, mature adults, no it is not common. It is common in intellectually stunted religious fundamentalists and extremists, but I don't think those particular zealots can be considered "rational", and I have my doubts as to whether or not we could call them "mature adults".    Embed Quote
