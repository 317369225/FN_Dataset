If mathematics is an exact science, why are there assumptions?
I would not say mathematics is even a science; I think it is better described as the language of science.   It is enough for mathematics that the theorems within are consistent. I think you can substitute "exact" for "certain" in this Einstein quote: "as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.    Embed Quote
