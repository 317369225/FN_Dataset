★Behavioral Economics: What are the most controversial assumptions of economics?
I can think of some economic principles — living standards can only rise if productivity does, free trade usually makes everyone better off, markets are usually the best way to organize economic activity, governments can sometimes improve outcomes, most situations involve tradeoffs, inflation is usually caused by printing too much money—that most economists embrace and many others don't, but assumptions? Perfect information. Perfect certainty.  Perfect competition. Perfect independence. Perfect rationality. What’s controversial isn't whether these are realistic, which of course they aren't, but, I think, how big a difference relaxing any of these assumptions makes in a given situation. In other words, do models that assume markets are perfectly competitive still yield good predictions? Can you get 80% of the answer with unrealistic assumptions. In some areas you can.    Embed Quote
