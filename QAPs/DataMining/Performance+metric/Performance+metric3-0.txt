★What are key performance metrics for a technology-oriented employee?technical, personal, interpersonal, others.
KPI's should be related to the outcomes associated with one's specific role, otherwise they are too watered down to be useful. The best KPI plans I have seen consist of two numbers- A leading indicator and a lagging indicator. For a sales person this might be number of leads generated for the leading and closed sales dollars for the lagging. For technology folks, tie their KPIs to the business outcomes you are trying to drive. For example, if they are developing applications to make the company more efficient tie their lagging indicator to reduced operation expense (or reduced opex per unit of work).    Embed Quote
