★What is a good graphing framework for tracking and measuring performance metrics?It would be useful to have something which measures overall site performance, memory usage on servers, CPU, etc. Ganglia (http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/) seems to be useful for measuring cpu, memory, load, and metrics like that for a cluster, but doesn't have a fantastic way to record things that span single servers (like frontend javascript performance time).
Not to toot our own horn too aggressively, but New Relic is built for exactly that. http://newrelic.com/rum    Embed Quote
