★I'm considering joining a startup as the marketing director (3rd member). They don't have money for a salary. Should I ask for equity, or are there other ways for a marketing director to get paid - a cut based on performance metrics?
There is a simple way to look at this. If they are asking you to join without pay as the 3rd member, then they better be willing to bring you on as a cofounder. You not only should get equity, but you should get it as founders' shares (i.e. a restricted stock grant, not options, not stock in lieu of cash). The percentage of the company they should offer will be dependent on how far along development is and what your role is and will be in the future. According to a 2008 survey that I just looked at, the median equity position for a Head of Marketing founder was 2.5%, the average was 7.19%. The discrepancy between median and average can be explained by the criticality of the member to the founding team. That is, a Head of Marketing founder who was instrumental in the conception of the company would have more than someone whose contribution is solely outbound marketing.    Embed Quote
