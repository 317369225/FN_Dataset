★When using performance metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, the Sortino ratio, information ratio, tracking error, excess return and volatility to measure the performance of a long/short only equity portfolio, which is re-balanced each quarter, are there any relationships that should be evident?What would imply a good/bad portfolio? Are there thresholds for each metric to look out for?
Your Sharpe Ratio and Sortino Ratios should be high (greater than 1.25 for Sharpe is good, 2 is very good). If you increase your excess returns and lower the volatility, it will automatically boost your Sharpe Ratio--that is what it is based on. If you decrease the severity of your drawdowns while increasing your upside volatility, your Sortino ratio will increase. Tracking error is irrelevant since you aren't tracking an index.    Embed Quote
