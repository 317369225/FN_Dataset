★How transparent should startups be with all employees regarding revenue, profitability and key business performance metrics?There is a natural tendency is to guard that type of information, but are there any real disadvantages in being open and transparent about finances?  From my perspective laying it all on the table along with goals for the upcoming year will only help motivate the team.
Trust motivates the team to work towards successful startups, What's better than being open and sharing the numbers and goals with all employees to earn trust. Also give them chance to contribute. This will definitely build trust and a strong bond in which the startups ship can sail even during high tides. A word of caution, sharing too much about perspective investors or open deal/business will not be a good idea as per human tendency employees might share with others before it close. - Himanshu Kakkar T : @kakkarhimanshu    Embed Quote
