★I'm considering joining a startup as the marketing director (3rd member). They don't have money for a salary. Should I ask for equity, or are there other ways for a marketing director to get paid - a cut based on performance metrics?
In my opinion, the equity is the fairest way (for you and for the company) to join a startup that has no money. However, the equity it's a benefit, non a subsitute for salary. So I would like also to formalize some agreement for a salary when certain conditions occours.    Embed Quote
