★I'm considering joining a startup as the marketing director (3rd member). They don't have money for a salary. Should I ask for equity, or are there other ways for a marketing director to get paid - a cut based on performance metrics?
I would hesitate to take a position that did not include payment for value without a detailed contract stating the equity percentages, agreed upon time frame before they start paying you and downside considerations if they do not make a profit.  Touch base with a lawyer to have this fully flushed out, because you are taking a huge risk with a start up.  Even if it is a fantastic business - if you are number three, there could be two votes against any plan you put into place to generate revenue.  And the best marketer in the world can fail if the sales or executive teams are not 100% on board.    Best of luck in this position.    Embed Quote
