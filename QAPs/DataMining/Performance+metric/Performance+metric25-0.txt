★I'm considering joining a startup as the marketing director (3rd member). They don't have money for a salary. Should I ask for equity, or are there other ways for a marketing director to get paid - a cut based on performance metrics?
I would definitely ask for an equity position.  You are taking on risk and should share in the benefit if the company does well.  In addition,  I would ask to be paid. If the company seeks funding (Angel or Private Equity), and if they secure funding, you should be able to start drawing a salary based on some agreed upon rate.  I would suggest getting an employment contract that outlines exactly when and how you are paid from both a salary perspective and equity position.  Good luck.    Embed Quote
