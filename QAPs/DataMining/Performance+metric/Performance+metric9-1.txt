★Which employee performance metrics are most useful to managers? Why?
KPIs such as: Average Quality of a product based on a scale (ex 0-4, 0-10) Cost per X / Revenue per X (X - hour, product bought/sold) Average number of X (X - produced per day/week/month or X for sold items) Average time spent on X (X - task, product, phone call, etc) Using standardized KPIs and average or/and ratios shows High/Low performance and space for improvement both for employee as well as for the department overall. Presented in a graph this can work great both for Management as well as for weekly/monthly discussions with employees. Works also as a good backup for salary negotiations and further development.    Embed Quote
