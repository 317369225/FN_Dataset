★Which employee performance metrics are most useful to managers? Why?
Depends on the function of the employee, but for routine jobs I guess I'd have to say attendance; being at work on time on a regular basis, physically and mentally prepared, appropriately dressed, not drunk or hung over. The above are visible and easy to measure.    Embed Quote
