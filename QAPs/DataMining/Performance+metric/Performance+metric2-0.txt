★How does the team performance metric or 'fitness function' work at Amazon?It is said that every team at Amazon has a fitness function which is an equation that translates the business value of this team into a single number. Every function needs to be approved by Jeff Bezos. Its benefit would be a quick overview of a team's performance, especially for those less familiar with the actual team. Is this still being used? How do teams come up with their functions?
Fitness functions of the form that you described (an objective function that encapsulates various key metrics) are no longer commonplace at Amazon. This isn't to say that teams don't focus obsessively on measuring business results and operational metrics - it's simply no longer captured in a nifty equation. As you can imagine, different teams had different fitness functions based on what their goals were. For instance, the Recommendations team had a fitness function that included a number of customer-facing inputs to capture the effectiveness of the feature(s) across a wide set of customers, instead of simply focusing on the revenues generated by the features (which could be driven up by a small number of customers). Inputs included the number of customer who clicked through on a recommended product on the website, the number of people who rated a recommendation 4 or 5 stars, the number of people who marked a recommendation "Not Interested" etc.    Embed Quote
