★As an e-commerce startup, what are your favorite performance metrics?
1) ROAS - Return on advertising spend - How well am I making my advertising dollars work for me? 2) Conversion rate - Duh, what percentage of people are converting? 3) Cart abandonment rate - Once people hit the cart, how many leave? Break this into a funnel and see at what step in the process they leave so you can optimize. 4) Bounce rate - Am I sending paid traffic to relevant pages? If so, I hope they're advancing to at least one page instead of bouncing. 5) Gross margin - Is the product mix steering customers towards better margin products? Is the UI steering customers to understand the product mix? See my answer On average, how much net profit should a start-up (retail/e-commerce) be looking to make? 6) AOV - What is the average order value? Can I do anything to incentivize increasing it? E.g. if the AOV is $100 can I provide free shipping at $120 to incentivize an accessory purchase? (Why pay $7 for shipping when I can pay $20 for an accessory and get free shipping) 7) Items per order - Are people bundling purchases? Accessory sales are high margin, push them!    Embed Quote
