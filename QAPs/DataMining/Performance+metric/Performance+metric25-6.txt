★I'm considering joining a startup as the marketing director (3rd member). They don't have money for a salary. Should I ask for equity, or are there other ways for a marketing director to get paid - a cut based on performance metrics?
Joining as a 3. member and not getting a salary? that means the startup is in the early startup phase and then you could be considered as a cofounder. and that would include equity. how much ? depends on what the other 2 members already have achieved, developed, drafted, etc. and depends on the potential of the startup idea. but nevertheless: you should request an employment contract regulating your duties, tasks, roles, salary conditions (from when and how much), etc.    Embed Quote
