★What are the most important performance metrics for tech support?I'm specifically looking for things like "time-to-resolution" and "average time spent with customer", etc. Anything specific to a company is great but I'm also looking for industry standard terms. Measurements involving cost are also OK but I'm more interested in non-cost related metrics. Literally any answer or lead would be appreciated, thanks!
Too many variables to give a single answer. The length of time the customer has to wait before the call is answered, length of time it takes to complete a call, the number of times the customer has to call about the same issue.  All of these can be considered important in the tech support business. However, the most important metric this quarter may not matter next quarter. You can find a lot these here http://www.customermanagementiq....    Embed Quote
