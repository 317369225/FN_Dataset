★When analyzing equity or fund performance, how do you determine the appropriate time frame to use when calculating performance metrics, such as Sharpe ratio?While it is straightforward to calculate many financial metrics, their values can vary wildly depending on whether you look at performance over the last year, five years, ten years, etc... How do professional investors decide the appropriate time frame to use in their investment analysis?
A good rule of thumb is to first select a timeframe that has as many different market regimes as possible within it.  For example, bull market, bear market, sideways market, periods of high volatility, periods of low volatility etc.  The metrics for the fund or equity across the whole of that period will act as your baseline. Then if you slice up the periods within that and test each, your objective should be that the results of each slice are similar to the overall metrics, otherwise it's a sign the returns may be inconsistent, or that the fund's approach is suited to just one or two particular market environments. If the fund or equity being analysed can perform consistently well across all market regimes, that's a sign of robustness.    Embed Quote
