★What are some of the product and performance metrics that Google focuses on the most?For example in Google Search, YouTube etc
I will not be able to tell you what exactly Google uses, but it is very common to use Start-up Metrics for Pirates - AARRR. Here is what it stands for: A-Acquisitions, how differnet channels are performing when it comes to generating traffic. A-Activation, percentage of users who sing-up or activate their account. Top channels that drive activations. R-Retention. Users coming back, and using your product again and again. R-Referrals. How are you driving referrals? Who are the people that are spreading your product to the messes? R-revenue. Uses that make you money.    Embed Quote
