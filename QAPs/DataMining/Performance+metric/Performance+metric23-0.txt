★What are some performance metrics that are used to measure an oil company's upstream operation's efficiency?
The metrics we care most about at my company, in no particular order, are: Earnings per barrel - measures profitability in a way that allows easy comparisons between all the major operators despite different sizes Barrels oil equivalent produced per day - measures how big the company is in terms of oil+gas production (obviously, multiply this times earnings per barrel to get earnings) Total recordable incident rate (TRIR) and lost-time incident rate (LTIR) - safety metrics per million man-hours worked, EXTREMELY high priority is put on keeping these low by working safe. More of our incentive plan bonus is based on this than any other factor. Studies show safe rigs are also the most productive rigs, so this is a win-win. Incidence of non-conformance (INC) count -  number of times the federal government cites us for violations (spills, safety code oversights, etc) Number of spills above a certain volume threshold (spills are usually small amounts of drilling mud accidentally going overboard, oil is rare) Reserves/production ratio and reserves replacement - these measure the financial future of the company... how long can we keep pumping at the current rate, and are our reserves growing or shrinking?    Embed Quote
