★I'm considering joining a startup as the marketing director (3rd member). They don't have money for a salary. Should I ask for equity, or are there other ways for a marketing director to get paid - a cut based on performance metrics?
I would frame it as a value proposition.  If you are successful in this role, what are some reasonable dimensions to express the value of your contribution?  If whoever fills this role fails at it, what are the dimensions of that failure?  The delta between success and failure in this role is a measure of the value you contribute.  What is the size of this delta?  Is it tens or hundreds of millions of dollars?  Once you have identified an approximate scale for your contribution, see if you can also estimate the delta for the other members of your organization.  If you can provide approximations that they agree are reasonable, I think you will find that an argument to provide you with equity proportionate to your contribution will be well received.  If it is not well received, you should probably re-consider this partnership. The question of whether you should be gambling your time, talent, and capital on a startup is entirely different.  Again, try to measure the delta between success and failure in your personal life if this startup succeeds or fails, bearing in mind that most startups fail.  Do you have enough personal wealth to survive unpaid for however long it takes?  Or are you planning on taking on a crushing load of personal debt to see you through this period?  Are you free of other obligations such as kids, a mortgate, and other debt?  Are you young enough to rebuild, if this startup fails? (Please always bear in mind that most do).  Ultimately, nobody but you can answer these questions.  "Ya puts up yer money, an' ya takes yer chances".  Good luck!    Embed Quote
