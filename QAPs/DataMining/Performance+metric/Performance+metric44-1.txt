★If an airline was able to control on which flight and where in the plane people sit based on their weight, would this in any way increase some of the key performance metrics of the industry in an economically meaningful way?
An exact weight would enable a better control on the center of gravity and save some fuel. Would it change the performance in a meaningful way... I don't think so.    Embed Quote
