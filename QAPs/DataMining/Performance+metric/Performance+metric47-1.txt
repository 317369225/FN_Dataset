★When monitoring MySQL performance, which metrics are most important to watch?Some monitoring tools can collect literally hundreds of metrics about MySQL performance. Which of these are most important to watch to in order to learn about problems as quickly as possible, and to diagnose the cause of the problem?
The most important metrics to pay attention is server CPU, memory usage, free disk space, free swap space, MySql availaibility, error logs etc. I have named the most important and i pay attention to them when I my monitor my MySQL performance with the help of Anturis (Cloud-based Monitoring Service for Servers and Websites, IT Infrastructure Monitoring) which I consider to be one of the best monitoring tools at present. It finds the problem and offers troubleshooting. In case you are not experienced enough or so is your sys admin it can be of great help.    Embed Quote
