★What mobile app performance metrics are correlated highly with engagement? App startup time? Crash rates? Something else?
Retention, especially long tail retention like D30, D90, D180. Depending on the app monetisation, revenue related metrics. Depending on the app design, a mix of average session length and number of session. This needs some thought though. What do we expect the usage of the app to be. For example, a news aggregator is expected to be used daily at least once. I tend to use specific metrics for engagement. Each app has a number of events that will be a measure of engagement. For instance, a soccer flicker could be the average number of goals scored daily per player. Imagine how the app will be used and you'll find how it engages (or not) the users.    Embed Quote
