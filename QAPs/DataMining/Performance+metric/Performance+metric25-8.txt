★I'm considering joining a startup as the marketing director (3rd member). They don't have money for a salary. Should I ask for equity, or are there other ways for a marketing director to get paid - a cut based on performance metrics?
1: If someone came to offer one position without basic salary or stock option proposal, I doubt whether they really need me because it means they have no idea how much value I can bring to this startup. 2: What do you think about this company? Do you have confidence on this company? If yes and you can make living without any incoming for at least 6-12 months, of course take the equity.    Embed Quote
