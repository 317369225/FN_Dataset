★What are the most important performance metrics for tech support?I'm specifically looking for things like "time-to-resolution" and "average time spent with customer", etc. Anything specific to a company is great but I'm also looking for industry standard terms. Measurements involving cost are also OK but I'm more interested in non-cost related metrics. Literally any answer or lead would be appreciated, thanks!
The first answer to your question is another question - what is it your customers are looking for from your customer support? You really need to understand what it is that they value - First answer accuracy? Very rapid response? Multiple ways to get answers? Once you understand that you can build the metrics that tie to that. But a few thoughts on the core measures: Customer satisfaction needs to be the core measure. Most companies measure this via a transaction survey after the support incident is resolved. Resolution time - from open time to when the customer confirms the issue is completely resolved. Response time - How quickly does the customer receive the first substantive response from your support (not just a "we got it" notification). Backlog - this is an internal measure that reflects the ultimate resolution time, but is critical for understanding the amount of work currently in process within the organization. Percentage defect related versus "how-to" - depending on the product / service supported but it is good to know what amount of support comes from defects in the product itself versus what is due to customer need for usage help. That's a start though there are many more that might be applicable.    Embed Quote
