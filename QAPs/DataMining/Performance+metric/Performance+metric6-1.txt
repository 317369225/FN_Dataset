★Performance Metrics: Is shareholder value the most important measure of corporate success?
Yes. Profit comes from efficiently serving the needs of Customers by providing goods and/or services that they are willing to buy for the offered price in preference to the competition (one presumes because the competition is either higher priced or worse quality). Without customers, for-profit corporations die, and Shareholders lose their Capital. Thus is Shareholder Value the sine qua non of every for-profit corporation. Everything else is a matter of priorities set in law for all people & corporations by the political process of the society in which they all live and operate.    Embed Quote
