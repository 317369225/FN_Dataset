★I'm considering joining a startup as the marketing director (3rd member). They don't have money for a salary. Should I ask for equity, or are there other ways for a marketing director to get paid - a cut based on performance metrics?
I'll just touch on this.  If they know what they are doing, they will OFFER YOU EQUITY without you having to ask for it.  If they don't offer then either they are clueless about the very basics or they don't value your contribution (or perhaps the contribution of marketing).    Embed Quote
