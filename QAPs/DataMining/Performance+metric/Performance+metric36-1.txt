★When using performance metrics such as the Sharpe ratio, the Sortino ratio, information ratio, tracking error, excess return and volatility to measure the performance of a long/short only equity portfolio, which is re-balanced each quarter, are there any relationships that should be evident?What would imply a good/bad portfolio? Are there thresholds for each metric to look out for?
A long short portfolio should not have an invested benchmark, so tracking error and information ratio should not apply. The Sharpe ratio will give an indication on the the way risk was transformed in excess return. Sortino, Pain, Ulcer, Calmar, Burke, Omega, Kappa,... ratios  will provide a clearer focus on risk as downside risk. If markets are perfectly efficient, Sharpe of long/short should be zero or close. In practice, 0,3 - 0,5 on live portfolios is excellent. Over the long term, this is more or less what can be expected from risky asset classes. To be truely useful a long/short portfolio should not only offer an attractive Sharpe ratio but genuine diversification. It is therefore important to demonstrate independence from any systematic risk factor: market, style, sector, etc. Anything above 0,5 should be taken with caution and anything above 1 with suspicion. Most often the reason for overstatement of risk/return ratios is an underestimation of the risk when illiquid instruments are represented as riskless but many other biases may be at work. Paper portfolios generated in backtesting always show outstanding performance, if only because of survivorship bias. Indeed, what would be the point of showing a backtesting which did not outperform spectacularly. Such performance measures are virtual and close to meaningless.    Embed Quote
