★I'm considering joining a startup as the marketing director (3rd member). They don't have money for a salary. Should I ask for equity, or are there other ways for a marketing director to get paid - a cut based on performance metrics?
I'm not sure there is a right answer to this.  I'd generally suggest asking for the best "reasonable" deal you can, but this can go many ways.  A few things to think about: - Are there other things you are getting out of this?  If this is a chance to boost your career, the experience could be sufficient. - Do you have better alternatives elsewhere? - Does the startup have other alternatives? - If you ask for equity, which is not at all unreasonable, what is the level that is acceptable to you and the startup? - Would you prefer signing an agreement for cash payments based on milestones? - Would you like to be with the company for the long haul? There is almost always some flexibility in the arrangement; having an honest, open conversation is much more likely to find the best mix.    Embed Quote
