★How would you set individual performance metrics for a small team in a manner that would encourage cooperation and innovation rather than competition and "numbers chasing"?
Given this particular situation, I wouldn't recommend setting individual performance metrics, at least not in the way that I think you mean.  Rather, I'd recommend that you set performance goals at the team level, and set development goals at the individual level.  Then, you empower the team to meet their performance goals in whatever way they believe that they can do so as a cohesive team.  And you review development goals on the individual level, to ensure that people are growing in addition to achieving. The best way to make people engage in achieving a goal is to empower them to do so, and the best way to do that is to put their fate in their own hands, and provide them with problems to solve or goals to achieve, then watch and oversee how they choose to achieve those goals or solve those problems. If this sounds a lot like Agile software development, that's because it is -- but the principals of that approach apply to any group of people who need to meet a goal.    Embed Quote
