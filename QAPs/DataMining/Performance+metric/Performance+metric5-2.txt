★What are good performance metrics on a gym rowing machine?What are the numbers that indicate my fitness and how well I'm doing on a rowing machine? For e.g maintaining a 90+ rpm while spinning is considered good. What is a good time to complete a 2000 m or a 5000 m row?
The first is the distance: try to reach the finish. Once you can try to monitor your pulse, you can easily increase your speed a litle after every minute. When your average record decrease in that distance your heart will have adapted a litle at least.    Embed Quote
