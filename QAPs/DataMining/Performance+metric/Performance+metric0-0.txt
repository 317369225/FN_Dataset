★If you run a B2B company, what are the most important performance metrics for your VP of Marketing?
I agree with all the above/below, but let me add one nuance on Lead Generation: >> I think the #1 most important metric is Increase in Leads Generated, Month Over Month. We set a 8-10% MoM qualified lead growth target at EchoSign, post-traction, depending on our phase/scale. By measuring qualified lead growth each and every month ... and setting a firm goal to increase them x% a month ... you'll hit your revenue targets. Set it a percent or two higher than your revenue growth goal, and if you have a good in-bound sales team ... it will all come together.    Embed Quote
