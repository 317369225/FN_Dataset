★If an airline was able to control on which flight and where in the plane people sit based on their weight, would this in any way increase some of the key performance metrics of the industry in an economically meaningful way?
In the US, average weights are used, and these averages differ from season to season. In the Bahamas where I flew with an airline there, they use actual weights. They don't ask people how much they weigh, rather, the check in agent makes an educated guess. These guesses often become lazy as we once had an incident where the paperwork had us more than 3000lbs overweight because they had three kids which were supposed to be 50lbs at 500lbs each. Other than that, the weights were never ever accurate. I was often told that before the changed to an actual weight system they had much more flexibility with fuel reserves. With the switch to actual weights there were few people that were the actual "average weight" which means we practically always had to leave baggage and cargo on full flights. While I think the "average weights" need to be updated. Using an actual weight system could be problematic.    Embed Quote
