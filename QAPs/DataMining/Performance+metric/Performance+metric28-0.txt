★What is the best way to compare the performance (metrics) of my own apps versus the competition?Is there any source of market data for mobile apps (across different platforms) where it is possible to compare different apps? How can I tell how my apps are performing agains their competition? I'm interested on data like monthly downloads, sales, etc. In other words, where are the Nielsen and comScore for the mobile apps universe?
You can't get real analytical such as number of downloads on apps which are not yours, this information is not disclosed by Apple. You can however compare rankings, this is public information, You can use www.applyzer.com to do it nicely and easily. You can also find estimates of more analytical on www.appdata.com but they are guessing/estimating them, probably based on rankings...    Embed Quote
