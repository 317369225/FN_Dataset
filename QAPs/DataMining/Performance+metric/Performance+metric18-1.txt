★What are some good ways to reason about which performance metrics of an online service are the most important?For example, when deciding whether the metric to focus on should be "99th latency percentile" or "fraction of requests completed within 100ms".
Generally, this is a hard question with no precise answer. Practically, the final metric is often up to a single person making the decision. Therefore, a good way to reason about which metric to use is "A said X is a good one". I personally would prefer to stick with the metric that has to do with the high-level expectations from the service. For example, if the service is an online store, pick the metric that results in higher purchase rate. If there is a disagreement, measure. Artificially delaying the for 1% of users in one way and for 1% of users in another way for a day or less might be one quick way. If measurement is hard, and the end gain is unclear, don't bother. Chances are, any metric would be good enough. (Answered my own question from several months ago.)    Embed Quote
