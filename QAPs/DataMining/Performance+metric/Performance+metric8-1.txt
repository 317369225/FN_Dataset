★What are the most important performance metrics for advertisements on social networks?Common ones are CTR, Click to Install, ARPU, ARPPU, Viral Coefficient - any others?  Do people have other ways they think about or measure performance?
As a publisher, these are important: ARPU (average revenue per user) is important when comparing different ad networks. Don't compare eCPM. That number can be inflated by artificially reducing page view count. CTR (click through rate) is important when comparing different page layout. Some page layout may make your users notice the ads more. Viral Coefficient is important when balancing monetization vs. user experience. Some ads are very aggressive. You may be earning good money in the short term but may also destroy your user base.    Embed Quote
