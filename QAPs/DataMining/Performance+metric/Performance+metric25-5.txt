★I'm considering joining a startup as the marketing director (3rd member). They don't have money for a salary. Should I ask for equity, or are there other ways for a marketing director to get paid - a cut based on performance metrics?
Thanks for the A2A. I believe that equity would be the smartest move, as long as you are confident in what the startup is selling. That being said, what type of corporation is this startup? This may change my answer.    Embed Quote
