★What are the most important performance metrics for advertisements on social networks?Common ones are CTR, Click to Install, ARPU, ARPPU, Viral Coefficient - any others?  Do people have other ways they think about or measure performance?
Dave McClure suggests the following metrics in the context for a startup business in general; but you can easily apply it your social network advertisement channels: Slide 33: http://500hats.typepad.com/500bl... . Key takeaways Dave defines: ATV - Avg Transaction Value (not the television, Apple TV, or the 4-wheeler). In context of social games, I have seen a variation of this denoted as ARPPU - Average Revenue Per Paying User ARPU - already mentioned CLV - Customer Lifetime Value (I have also seen it denoted as LTV) FYI - however you define these numbers/ratios, you're fundamentally looking for AARRR.  Create your own metrics/measurements that apply to these principles: Slide 21: AARRR Acquisition Activation Retention Referral Revenue When you have set some benchmarks, you can start doing more A/B testing on many different fronts, and break apart your campaigns for different goals.  Conversions on Creatives Conversions on Call to Actions or Copy Conversions on Promotions/Discounts Conversions on Virality (Coefficient/Virality) Conversions on Leads Conversions on Targetting (Demo/Interests/Category/etc) etc. A good funnel analysis will help you identify dropoffs - sometimes seeing the whole picture makes a difference.  Read this from the Mixpanel's co-founder Tim Trefren: http://blog.mixpanel.com/3-new-w... For example, a user coming in from an ad may not be at fault for low conversion, something else going on is stopping user from converting (example: terrible registration process, poor landing page, difficult payment, localization issues, broken code/bugs/browser incompatibility/device incompatibility).    Embed Quote
