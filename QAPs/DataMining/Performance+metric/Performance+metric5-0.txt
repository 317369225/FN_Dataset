★What are good performance metrics on a gym rowing machine?What are the numbers that indicate my fitness and how well I'm doing on a rowing machine? For e.g maintaining a 90+ rpm while spinning is considered good. What is a good time to complete a 2000 m or a 5000 m row?
The best way to find an average derived from a sufficiently large data-set is to go to the Concept2 website, create an account, log in, and go to the "Rankings" tab. There you can enter your age and weight class, and check on the 2k and 5k times of many, many rowers.    Embed Quote
