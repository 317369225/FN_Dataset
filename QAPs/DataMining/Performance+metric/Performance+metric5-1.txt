★What are good performance metrics on a gym rowing machine?What are the numbers that indicate my fitness and how well I'm doing on a rowing machine? For e.g maintaining a 90+ rpm while spinning is considered good. What is a good time to complete a 2000 m or a 5000 m row?
Most rowers use the "split" metric to gauge effort on the indoor rowing machine.  This is the min:sec /500m readout, and it's an estimate of how long it would take you to hypothetically row 500m on the water given the current effort expended.  Of course, you can change the readout to display watts, total meters/total time, etc., but the average split for your entire workout piece is the most commonly used metric.  The split is generally displayed as an instantaneous data point and will update every stroke. As far as "good times" are concerned, it really depends on how serious of a rower you are.  For an average person with no specific training to sit down and complete an 8:00 2km or a 20:00 5km piece (both at an average split of 2:00/500m), that's pretty good.  For a male heavyweight elite rower, you would expect those average splits to be in the 1:30-1:35 range.  A good male heavyweight collegiate rower will probably average 1:40 for a 5km piece.  (Heavyweight = greater than 150 lbs.) For a more specific response, you'll have to give some context to your question.    Embed Quote
