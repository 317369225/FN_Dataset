★If you run a B2B company, what are the most important performance metrics for your VP of Marketing?
Revenue, customer acquisition, endorsements (analysts, editors, customer references etc), and qualified opportunities.  Never focus on leads, PR, and brand metrics without tying back to real world revenue and opportunities.    Embed Quote
