★How transparent should startups be with all employees regarding revenue, profitability and key business performance metrics?There is a natural tendency is to guard that type of information, but are there any real disadvantages in being open and transparent about finances?  From my perspective laying it all on the table along with goals for the upcoming year will only help motivate the team.
I handle growth at Hubstaff (time tracking software with proof of work) and I am proud to say that we are very transparent about our company's growth and revenue numbers. Infact, we have a public revenue dashboard. To be honest, we haven't seen any real disadvantages of making our metrics public till now and the pros definitely outweigh the cons. And you are right, it does motivate the team. :) You can also check out our growth blog where we are sharing all growth strategies that worked for us while growing our company.    Embed Quote
