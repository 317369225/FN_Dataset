★I'm considering joining a startup as the marketing director (3rd member). They don't have money for a salary. Should I ask for equity, or are there other ways for a marketing director to get paid - a cut based on performance metrics?
You need paid, in either equity or dollar bills for your service. Marketing is not always the easiest job to constantly and consistently quantify. Even the best marketers work as part of a team so it can be hard to identify "your" exact contribution. This makes it different from a job like sales that is very easy to quantify and defend. You never want to put yourself in a "one down" position to constantly need to justify your value. Bottom line if they don't have $$$ you need equity. If they aren't willing to give you money or equity they are telling you they see you with no value, at that point you should walk away.    Embed Quote
