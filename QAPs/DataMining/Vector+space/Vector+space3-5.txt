★Linear Algebra: Why is the dimension of a vector space well-defined?The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis. But I can write down many different bases for a given vector space. How do I know that all such bases must have the same number of elements? (This question is part of my Technical Notes Project.)
Jack Huizenga has given a very nice answer. I just thought I'd write a little about the "exchange lemma" (in the text I use it's called the "replacement theorem") because, while it was poorly explained to me as an undergraduate and caused a lot of confusion, it really doesn't have to be so bad. Proving it may be worthwhile, since it reduces the proof that all bases are the same size to an easy and elegant corollary. Source of the below: Linear Algebra, 4th Ed., by Friedberg, Insel, & Spence. (I'll be substantially rewording and paraphrasing how they put things, so I won't use the blockquote format here.) Exchange lemma, aka Replacement theorem: The first part of this result says if span(G) = V, where |G|=n (i.e. V has a generating set of n elements), and L is a linearly independent subset of V with |L|=m, then we have m < n or m=n. So the size of a generating set is the biggest size for a linearly independent set. This is very intuitive, since a generating set may have redundant elements if it's not linearly independent. The second part says if m < n holds in the above, there can be found a subset L' of G with |L'| = n - m and span(L U L') = V. If instead m=n, then span(L) = V. In words, any linearly independent set that's too small to generate V can have more vectors thrown in from a given generating set, the vectors chosen appropriately, so that the result does generate V. Also, a linearly independent set as big as a generating set already is a generating set. Admittedly more technical than part one, but digestible and believable. The proof of these facts is surprisingly touchy (done by induction on n in this book). But the facts themselves are easy to believe. Now to see how we get that all bases have the same size: suppose B and B' are two bases for V, with |B| = n. We want to show |B'| = n, so without loss of generality, assume that |B'| > n. Then we can pick n+1 members of B', and they're linearly independent, since B' is. But the replacement theorem (first part) says the biggest size for a linear independent set is the size of a generating set, which is n since by assumption as span(B) = V. Contradiction obtained. If instead |B'| < n is assumed above, the argument runs the same way, only switching the roles of B and B'. Note that we didn't need the second part of the replacement theorem to get that all bases have the same size. It's needed to prove that any linearly independent set that's as big as a basis must itself be a basis, and that any linearly independent set can be extended to become a basis.    Embed Quote
