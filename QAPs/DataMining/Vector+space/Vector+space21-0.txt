★What is an intuitive explanation of the exterior product of vector spaces?Optionally some illuminating examples of their utility.
Start with a vector space over a field   For an example, take 3-space over the field of real numbers For vectors    in  with  create a formal symbol, called a wedge product of vectors                                   subject to the conditions that wedge product is associative, linear in each of its arguments, and anticommutative.  When  identify    with the vector    in Associativity is the same condition as always.  Linear in the first argument means that       Without the further requirement that wedge be anticommutative, what we've described so far is a tensor product, but we require further that                                   Notice that this requirement of anticommutativity implies that                                           for every vector  The collection of all these wedge products of vectors forms what is called the exterior algebra   It is a vector space over the field   If the dimension of    is  then the dimension of    is  In our example you can show that every 4-wedge    equals  The rest of the elements in    will be vectors, wedges of two vectors, or wedges of three vectors.  The vector space   has the standard basis  and the elements of  can be represented as scalar multiples of wedges of them.  The wedge product    of three vectors is equal to some multiple of    that multiple being the determinant of the 3x3 matrix whose columns are the coordinates of the three vectors     Embed Quote
