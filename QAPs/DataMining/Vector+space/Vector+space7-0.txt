★How do mathematicians understand vector spaces?
Consider: a first meal at a high-class restaurant with a  very meaningful date. One one pair of axes: cost-of-plate versus potential-esteem-for you. Each menu option has a vector. Another pair of axes: cost-of-plate versus affordable-cost. Again, a vector for each plate. Now: envisage a 3-space with axes of  plate item vs affordable cost versus potential esteem. You'll get a bunch of vectors that will tell you what the what the trade-off is per plate versus the likelihood of your date ending 'nicely' versus the affordability of a 'nice' outcome. That's a vector space. Now: do mathematicians take first dates to high-class restaurants?  That's a different question.    Embed Quote
