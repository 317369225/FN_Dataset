★How do you prove that every vector space contains a zero vector?
Usually it is assumed from the definition of a vector space. However, you can also prove that a vector which behaves like zero exists, based on the existence of an additive identity in the scalar field, and the distributive property. Let be any vector.  Then .  Thus, for any , is a zero vector. But, this proof has a problem.  We don't have any good way to show that for some other vector.  And, indeed, there are models of algebras that satisfy the other vector space axioms but don't have a (vector-)additive identity.    Embed Quote
