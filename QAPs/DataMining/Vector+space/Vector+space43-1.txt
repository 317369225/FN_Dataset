★What are some good analogies to explain vector space to a person who just knows the basic definition of a vector?
A vector space can be thought of as a set of elements (namely all possible vectors in whatever system you are using) that have certain "operations" defined on them, as is the case with regular numbers. In particular, you have addition of two vectors to produce another unique vector, and multiplication by a number also produces a vector. The most important property of a vector space, however, is that is linear; in other words, it satisfies that associative and distributive properties (which are analgous to what they are for numbers). See Dan Piponi's answer to What is a vector space? for more details.    Embed Quote
