★What are motivating ways to introduce General Vector spaces?
I'm not entirely certain if this would apply to all introductory students, but you could introduce Fourier analysis from the perspective of approximation of a function to a general vector space. There is also the possibility of introducing the Legendre polynomials (and their corresponding general vector space), as they are a key component of the solutions to time-independent Schrodinger wave equation. After taking my first upper level physics class (Modern Physics), I puzzled over what was so special about the separated angular solutions for the wavefunctions of the Hydrogen atom.  It wasn't until a year and a half later learning Linear Algebra (specifically when talking about Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalizing continuous functions) that it was revealed why they were so special. Hopefully that gives a couple of ideas to generate interest in the engineering and physics students, at a minimum. Credit goes to Dr. Michael Lachance of the University of Michigan-Dearborn, the linear algebra professor that introduced both Fourier analysis and Legendre polynomials to my class during the section on general vector spaces.    Embed Quote
