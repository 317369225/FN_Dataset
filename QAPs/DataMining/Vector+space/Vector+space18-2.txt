★What are motivating ways to introduce General Vector spaces?
Here is a keynote ;  David Hernández's answer to Graph Theory: Is there any application of graph theory to  mechanical engineering? A lot of information about the graph comes from to simple matrix computations, A la , finding  number of paths from one vertex to another of length m as the appropriate entry of .                   The setting for all of linear algebra is in some vector space. Intuitively this is just a collection of objects, which we call vectors, with some rules on how you can combine vectors to get other vectors. To learn more do x.    Embed Quote
