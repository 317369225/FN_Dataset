★What is an intuitive explanation of the exterior product of vector spaces?Optionally some illuminating examples of their utility.
To expand on what David Joyce wrote, in the case that we're looking at the exterior algebra on a Euclidean space there's a natural geometric interpretation of the wedge product. You can think of v wedge w as the oriented plane element spanned by v and w. Because it's oriented, you'd expect to get the opposite orientation if you swapped the factors, which gives us the anticommutativity relation v wedge w = -(w wedge v). Wedge products of three vectors represent oriented volumes and so on. Over n-space, the wedge product of n+1 vectors is always zero, and the wedge products of n vectors form a one-dimensional subspace of the exterior algebra. This has the interesting property that if you take a linear operator defined on n-space and extend it to the exterior algebra in a particular way and then restrict it to this top-level subspace, the result must be multiplication by a constant. Since a wedge product of n vectors in n-space represents an oriented n-volume in that space, this constant factor is basically the factor by which the linear map expands or contracts n-dimensional volumes. This is more traditionally known as the determinant of the original unextended map. (The extension process roughly is designed so that if f is the linear map then f(A wedge B) = f(A) wedge f(B). As an exercise you could try to fill out the details of this. The crucial property of the extension is that it's grade-preserving, that is, the top-level subspace I described above is an invariant subspace of it.)    Embed Quote
