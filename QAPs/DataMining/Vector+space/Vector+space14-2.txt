★How can you show that this vector space is linearly independent?Let V be a vector space, given a collection of vectors v1,· · · vn ∈ V, and invertible linear transformation T : V → V . Show that {v1,· · · vn} are linearly independent if and only if {T v1,· · · T vn} are linearly independent.
This proof is a bi-implication off the form which is . Therefore let us prove the second equivalent proposition. Let be a vector space and and invertible linear transformation . Let this vector space be over an arbitary field Let us prove the math] \neg q \rightarrow \neg p[/math]: Let such that they are not all zero and .  Since is a linear transformation, . Since T is an invertible map, it is injective. . (T(0) = 0 for any linear transformation) Due to the injective nature of , . Since not all of the are zeros, is a linearly dependent set. This proves I would encourage you to try the    Embed Quote
