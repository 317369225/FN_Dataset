★What is a vector space?
A vector space is a set V on which two operations + and · are defined, called vector addition and scalar multiplication. The operation + (vector addition) must satisfy the following conditions: Closure: If u and v are any vectors in V, then the sum u + v belongs to V. (1) Commutative law: For all vectors u and v in V, u + v = v + u (2) Associative law: For all vectors u, v, w in V, u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w (3) Additive identity: The set V contains an additive identity element, denoted by 0, such that for any vector v in V, 0 + v = v and v + 0 = v. (4) Additive inverses: For each vector v in V, the equations v + x = 0 and x + v = 0 have a solution x in V, called an additive inverse of v, and denoted by - v. The operation · (scalar multiplication) is defined between real numbers (or scalars) and vectors, and must satisfy the following conditions: Closure: If v in any vector in V, and c is any real number, then the product c · v belongs to V. (5) Distributive law: For all real numbers c and all vectors u, v in V, c · (u + v) = c · u + c · v (6) Distributive law: For all real numbers c, d and all vectors v in V, (c+d) · v = c · v + d · v (7) Associative law: For all real numbers c,d and all vectors v in V, c · (d · v) = (cd) · v (8) Unitary law: For all vectors v in V, 1 · v = v Subspaces Definition: Let V be a vector space, and let W be a subset of V. If W is a vector space with respect to the operations in V, then W is called a subspace of V. Theorem: Let V be a vector space, with operations + and ·, and let W be a subset of V. Then W is a subspace of V if and only if the following conditions hold. Sub0 W is nonempty: The zero vector belongs to W. Sub1 Closure under +: If u and v are any vectors in W, then u + v is in W. Sub2 Closure under ·: If v is any vector in W, and c is any real number, then c · v is in W.    Embed Quote
