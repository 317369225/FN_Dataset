★Linear Algebra: In any vector space, what is the real difference between its spanning set and the basis? How do these differ? Please give some examples of a vector space where a spanning set can't be said to be the basis.
A spanning set is what you need in order to write any vector of the space as a sum of coefficient * vector in the set. For example: in a flat world, in order to reach any point (represented by a vector) starting from a chosen origin, you need two directions represented by two (non parallel) vectors. Let's call them A and B. To reach any point C you can say that you have to walk n steps along A, then m steps along B. Even if A and B are not of length one and are not orthogonal. In this example, n and m (number of steps) are the coefficients.   ___ _____  /___ /____/ /___/____/ If you live in a town in which the streets are like those above, the natural spanning set is the couple of vectors  ____  and /  which are not orthogonal, so they do not form a basis. Any crossing point is reached walking n steps along direction ____ and m steps along direction / A basis is a (particular) spanning set in which all vectors are of length one and are mutually orthogonal. In a flat world, a basis is given (for example) by | and _    Embed Quote
