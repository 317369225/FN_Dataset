★In linear algebra, when proving V is a vector space, instead of doing all of the ten properties, if V is closed under addition and is closed under scaler multiplication, can I stop there and say that V must be a vector space?Lets just say V is the set of all 2x2 matrices A=[a b 2b d](that is a 2 by 2 matrix). let + be standard addition and standard scalar multiplication .Can you please show me the simplest way to show if V is a vector space
You do need all the axioms. For instance lets take V to be the set of 2x2 matrices. But define addition such that A+B=I for all A and B and a A = I for all scalers a. V is trivially closed under these operations but its certainly not a vector space. You can inherit some of the axioms. You have not said over what field V is defined. If you say take V defined over the real number R. As R is a field you have associativity and commutativity for the individual elements. Showing the different axioms actually becomes quite trivial.    Embed Quote
