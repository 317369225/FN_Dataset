★What is a simple explanation of finite and infinite dimensional vector spaces?
Well, the obvious obviously. One has a finite number of dimensions and the other does not. The primary difference is in what exactly the basis is and does. In a finite dimensional vector space, any vector in the space is exactly a (finite) linear combination of your basis vectors. In the infinite dimensional case you run into a number of issues and the exact issues depend upon the type of space you're considering. For all Banach spaces (which include all Hilbert spaces) completeness of the spaces implies that the basis as defined for the finite dimensional case (the Hamel basis) would need to be not just infinite but uncountable. For a Hilbert space, you can construct an orthonormal basis, and then the linear span of this basis set are dense in the space. So technically, you might not be able to generate every vector in the space, but you can get close enough. Other generalizations are possible depending on the space and the level of generality...locally convex topological vector spaces for example.    Embed Quote
