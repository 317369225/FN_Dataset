★How can you show that this vector space is linearly independent?Let V be a vector space, given a collection of vectors v1,· · · vn ∈ V, and invertible linear transformation T : V → V . Show that {v1,· · · vn} are linearly independent if and only if {T v1,· · · T vn} are linearly independent.
What does it mean for the vectors to be linearly independent (or linearly dependent)? Once you answer 1, apply T (to what?) What do you observe after applying T? Can you reverse the process to prove the other implication? This question is simply testing your basic grasp of linear dependence and linear transformation.    Embed Quote
