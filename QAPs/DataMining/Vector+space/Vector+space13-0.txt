★What is an intuitive explanation of a norm of normed vector space?
Let's review the definition of a norm on a real vector space . It is a function with the properties that: 1.) iff 2.) 3.) () Notice two things: first, these conditions imply that satisfies the properties of a distance function---thus, the norm can be thought of as "distance from the origin." But a little more is true---the second and third properties basically tells us that the norm behaves nicely with respect to the vector space structure of . Very specifically, if I scale a vector, its length (the "distance from the origin") should scale just as much. The classic example of a norm on a vector space is the standard Euclidean norm on : . It is pretty easy to check that this is norm---it is the guiding example for defining norms in general. Here is another example that is a bit stranger: the taxi-cab norm on : (it is so named because if you are trying to figure out the distance by taxi between two points in New York, this is, for the most part, a reasonable estimate). "Circles" in this norm look like diamonds. You will find, though, that many of the same arguments that can be used to argue about the Euclidean norm can be used to argue about the taxi-cab norm. Here is a non-example: if , and otherwise. This is interesting because this function does define a distance from the origin (check!), but it does not play well with vector operations. In particular, it doesn't scale.    Embed Quote
