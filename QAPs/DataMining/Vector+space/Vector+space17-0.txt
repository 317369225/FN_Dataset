★Why is it impossible to define a nontrivial bilinear product in a general vector space so that the result remains in the same vector space?
You can form a lot of these products. Consider two linear functionals , where is the underlying vector space, and is the field of scalars asociated with the space (generally or ). Now consider a fixed vector . The next product is bilinear and the result lies on V. So each triplet gives a bilinear vector product over the vector space. Now you can make a more general product considering a lot of triplets like the one before and suming them. If is a collection of triplets where are linear functionals, and , then Is a bilinear product of vectors with a vector as a result. Is possible to show that every vector product is of this form! so there are a lot of them, and it's known their general structure, the one that i show you before. EDIT: The theorem that states that every bilinear  vector product is of the form i told you before is valid only for finite dimensional spaces. In an infinite dimensional space the example i provided gives a lot of bilinear vector products, but not every product is of this form.    Embed Quote
