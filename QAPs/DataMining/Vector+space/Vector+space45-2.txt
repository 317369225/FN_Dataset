★Intuitively, why does every operator on an odd-dimensional real vector space have an eigenvalue? Why is this not true for even-dimensional vector spaces?
As Mark Gritter noted the reason lies in the characteristic polynomial.  He gave also a simple algebraical argument why it has a real root in the odd-dimensional case.  There is also a simple analytical argument. For a monic polynomial of odd degree holds:   and . It implies that being a continuous a function must have at least one real root.  For even dimensions  . So it doesn't work. For example, ,    has no real eigenvalues.  The characteristic polynomial of  is . Therefore there are no real roots but a pair of complex conjugate roots.  This is also true that every monic polynomial with real coefficients is a characteristic polynomial of some real matrix, or, more generally, every matrix in its  -conjugacy class (see Companion matrix).  That is,  an arbitrary real monic polynomial with no real roots gives you in general a family of matrices without real eigenvalues .    Embed Quote
