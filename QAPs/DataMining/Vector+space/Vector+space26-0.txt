★What is a good way to understand what the Hermitian inner product is for a complex vector space?In particular, what does it mean for two complex vectors to be orthogonal, other than their having an inner product that is zero? Is there a way of visualizing this by analogy to what orthogonality means for real vectors?
It seems like you're assuming that a complex vector space somehow comes with some intrinsic geometry, and that a Hermitian inner product (not 'the', since they aren't unique) is somehow determined by this.  It's probably better to think of it the other way around.  That is, if you have a vector space, to put an inner product on it (Hermitian or otherwise) is to give your space some geometry.  Notions like orthogonality don't even exist without an inner product. Here's an example that will hopefully make this clear.  Let V be the vector space of complex polynomials.  What does it mean for two polynomials to be orthogonal?  So far, this doesn't make any sense.  But if we equip V with the following (Hermitian) inner product: then we have a notion of orthogonality. As far as visualization goes, I don't really have a good answer.  The best we can really do is to visualize real vector spaces in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions, and try to gain intuition from that.  (At least, that's the best that I can do.)  Trying to actually visualize something like a 10 dimensional complex vector space with some strange inner product on it seems unreasonable.     Embed Quote
