★Mathematics: Is a topology and a vector space somehow related?Their definitions sound very similar- while one is defined in terms of vectors (their sums and product with constants), the other in terms of arbitrary unions and intersections. While one should contain the empty set and the whole set the topology is specified one, the other should contain the zero vector. Is it possible to also point out what their differences is, if they are not that related?
Both of them are the kinds of things that mathematicians like to study, but that's about it. That is, they're sets which are closed under certain operations and which satisfy certain properties. Many objects of mathematical interest can be described thusly. Once you define maps in both contexts (continuous functions between topological spaces and linear maps between vector spaces) you can also understand both in the language of Category theory. But that's true of most things mathematicians study as well.    Embed Quote
