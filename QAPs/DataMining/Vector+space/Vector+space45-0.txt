★Intuitively, why does every operator on an odd-dimensional real vector space have an eigenvalue? Why is this not true for even-dimensional vector spaces?
The eigenvalues are zeros of the characteristic polynomial of a linear transformation (expressed as a matrix.)  The degree of the polynomial is equal to the dimension of the vector space. For real-valued vector spaces, it may be that some or all these roots are complex, and thus do not occur as eigenvalues.  But for an odd-dimensional vector space only an even number of those roots can be complex, so there is at least one real eigenvalue.    Embed Quote
