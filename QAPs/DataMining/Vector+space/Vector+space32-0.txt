★How can a Web search engine use the vector space model, TF/IDF, and PageRank altogether?
The PageRank of a webpage is independent of the search query, it is an intrinsic quality of a page. When a query is searched, the 'relevant' pages are ranked by their PageRank score. So PageRank doesn't take the query into considering. Usually a simple retrieval model is used to retrieve a huge corpus of webpages relevant to query and then they are ordered by their PageRanks. One can (and I think this is being used) use tf-idf based vector space model to retrieve the relevant pages and then rank them by PageRank. Also there are query-dependent hyperlink-based ranking algorithms e.g. the HITS algorithm which measure the intrinsic quality and relevance of a webpage to a given query. In this scheme also, a set of pages relevant to the query (using vector space model) are retrieved and their ranking is computed by hyperlink analysis (similar to PageRank). Since HITS is query-dependent, everything is happening in real time. Thus it is not very practical to be implemented as a web search engine, you will have to wait for minutes or hours for the search results. So the answer to your questions that if tf-idf based vector space model can be used in conjunction with PageRank is Yes and something similar to that is being used in current web search engines.    Embed Quote
