★If I have a set of points in a vector space that I believe lie on a low dimensional manifold, what methods are useful for determining the dimensionality of that manifold?
If you take a (low degree) polynomial kernel of your original vector space (say, polynomials up to degree 2 or 3 of your original variables), and do linear dimensional reduction (say, NMF, SVD, Random Projection, or some version of stochastic matrix decomposition) on the vectors lifted up into this space, and then look as a function of the rank of the reduction, at which rank do you end up capturing "a good chunk" of the variability of the data set?  This point may be a good measure of your underlying dimensionality. There's a lot of fuzziness in this answer (what does "a good chunk" mean, what kernel to choose, what does "a good measure" mean, etc), but it's probably the way I'd go about it if I had no idea what sort of lower dimensional manifold I was looking for.    Embed Quote
