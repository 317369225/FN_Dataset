★Mathematics: Is a topology and a vector space somehow related?Their definitions sound very similar- while one is defined in terms of vectors (their sums and product with constants), the other in terms of arbitrary unions and intersections. While one should contain the empty set and the whole set the topology is specified one, the other should contain the zero vector. Is it possible to also point out what their differences is, if they are not that related?
Topology and linear structure are fundamentally different ideas. The similarities you mention are superficial. The basic idea of a vector space is that you can add its elements and multiply them by real numbers. The basic idea of a topological space is that you know which subsets of the space are open, and that allows you to say what convergence means. You can have a vector space with no notion of convergence, and conversely you can have a topological space whose elements cannot be added together or multiplied by a real number. If you have a space which has both types of structure (and satisfying certain conditions ensuring that they interact in the way you'd expect), it's called a topological vector space.    Embed Quote
