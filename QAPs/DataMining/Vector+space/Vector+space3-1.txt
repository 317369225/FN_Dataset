★Linear Algebra: Why is the dimension of a vector space well-defined?The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis. But I can write down many different bases for a given vector space. How do I know that all such bases must have the same number of elements? (This question is part of my Technical Notes Project.)
It's helpful to distill the bare-bones property of "being a base" that makes this true. The theory that deals with this distillation is called Matroid Theory. It rests upon the observation that there are several areas in mathematics where something like "a basis", or "an independent set", or "a spanning set" is defined. For instance, we can abstractly define a notion of "independent set" in a generic setting. - The empty set is an independent set - A subset of an independent set is independent - If and are independent sets and is larger than , then you can find an element of such that adding it to still yields an independent set. That last property is somewhat easier to verify for vector spaces than the process you describe (in Mark Eichenlaub's answer), and it's not hard to show that once you have that property then all bases (defined as maximal independent sets) have the same size. The benefit of doing it this way is that once you come across similar situations, you get the invariance of size property for free once you confirm the axioms above. The most usual place for you to stumble upon this next is in the notion of transcendence degree of field extensions, but there are many other areas where matroids can be found lurking around and it's nice to be familiar with their existence.    Embed Quote
