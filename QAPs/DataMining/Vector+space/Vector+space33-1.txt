★How do you prove a subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space is finite dimensional?
Say we have a subspace A of n dimensions. Now consider the set B of vectors in A that have a zero component in some specified dimension i. Then two vectors in B can be written: The sum of these vectors is: . This vector is contained in B as well, meaning that B must be a subspace of A. Consider now that the number of non-null dimensions in B, dim(B), is at most n - 1. Thus if n is finite, so is n - 1, and with this we know that a subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space is also finite in dimensionality.    Embed Quote
