★What is the difference between a vector field and a vector space?
Imagine that you are riding a rollercoaster (represented by a flat stripe) and are allowed to move your head around in either direction (360 degrees :) The directions in which you may be looking and the distance to which you focus your eyes represent a vector bundle --- at every point, there is a vector space of possible configurations, and these configurations slide along the rollercoaster. This illustrates a tangent bundle mentioned by Daniel McLaury, and the geometric structure he mentions simply ensures a smooth ride - your gaze should not jitter too much if you hold your head steady. It's OK to gradually turn your head, which will result in a vector field --- at every point of the rollercoaster ride, you'd be looking somewhere (represented by a tangent vector). Now imagine a rollercoaster on a sphere or a torus. If the creature riding the rollercoaster has two heads (each with a pair of eyes), that would give a more complicated vector bundle and higher-dimensional vector fields.    Embed Quote
