★Linear Algebra: What is a simple example of a vector space which is not an inner product space?
Here are some truths, I hope some can help you: A. A vector space that is not equipped with an inner product is not an inner product space. B. Every finite-dimensional vector space can be equipped with an inner product. C. Most vector spaces that you encounter in your life can be equipped with an inner product, but some are useless or meaningless. D. An example of a vector space that doesn't have a meaningful inner product is the space consisting of all Borel measures on R^n.    Embed Quote
