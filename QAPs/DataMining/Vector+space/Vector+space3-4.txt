★Linear Algebra: Why is the dimension of a vector space well-defined?The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis. But I can write down many different bases for a given vector space. How do I know that all such bases must have the same number of elements? (This question is part of my Technical Notes Project.)
For finite-dimensional vector spaces the well-definedness of the dimension is a corollary of Theorem 4 in Hoffman and Kunze: Linear Algebra, Prentice-Hall, 2nd Edition: Let be a finite-dimensional vector space spanned by a collection of vectors, . Then any independent set of vectors in is finite and contains no more than vectors. The proof of this theorem simply consists in showing that any set of more than vectors will be linearly dependent. The proof of this is a straightforward generalization of the argument given by Jack Huizenga in his answer.    Embed Quote
