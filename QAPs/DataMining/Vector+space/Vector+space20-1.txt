★Linear Algebra: In any vector space, what is the real difference between its spanning set and the basis? How do these differ? Please give some examples of a vector space where a spanning set can't be said to be the basis.
A basis for a vector space contains just the right number of vectors needed to span the space. Not a vector more, not a vector less. For instance, the set of vectors {[1 0], [0 1], [1 1]} would span all of 2 dimensional real space, but this set is not the basis because it contains a redundant vector. A set of any two vectors from the above set would qualify as a basis, because those two vectors would be sufficient to span the space. Thus {[1 0], [0 1]} would qualify as a basis.    Embed Quote
