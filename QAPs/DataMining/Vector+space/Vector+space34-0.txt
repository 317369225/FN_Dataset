★Is Math 110 (Vector Space Methods for Differential Equations) worth taking at Harvard?
It depends on what you mean by worth taking, but I thought it was a really good class.  Bamberg is a lot better teaching in a small class setting like this and the math is really useful if you're a physics concentrator. It's not a particularly difficult class but it's a great alternative to a standard differential equations class.  You go over the basics of solving ODE's but then you get a taste of some deeper theory as well.  You learn some concepts from functional analysis (eg Hilbert space)  and end up studying PDE's like the wave equation, heat equation, and Schrödinger equation.    Embed Quote
