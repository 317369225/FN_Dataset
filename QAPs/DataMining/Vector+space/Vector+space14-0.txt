★How can you show that this vector space is linearly independent?Let V be a vector space, given a collection of vectors v1,· · · vn ∈ V, and invertible linear transformation T : V → V . Show that {v1,· · · vn} are linearly independent if and only if {T v1,· · · T vn} are linearly independent.
This looks like homework. Please do it yourself. There are lots of courses to help you online. Try Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra (Gilbert Strang lectures on Linear Algebra (MIT)). He's pretty good and easy to understand. In the end it'll be worth it. Tip - Lecture 9 will help you! :)    Embed Quote
