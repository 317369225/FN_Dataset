★Why doesn't the set of polynomials of degree equal to two form a vector space?
Edit: Andrew Weimholt makes the good point that polynomials of degree two strictly exclude polynomials of degree one and zero, which need to be included to get a vector space. My original answer assumes they were intended to be included. It's a Vector space in the linear algebra sense, in that you can take triples of coefficients representing polynomials and do addition and scalar multiplication on them to get other valid degree-2 polynomials. It's just not a Topological vector space (and in particular not a Euclidean space or a Hilbert space) which is mathematician-speak for what physicists are normally talking about when they mention vectors. That's a more complicated construct which basically has a separate linear algebra vector space at each point of a larger space (think of a Vector field), with some sort of topology relating the directions of vectors in the spaces at neighbouring points. Sadly, physicists sow confusion about this because in Physics 101 we start out by presenting finite displacements in space as the prototypical vector. However that conflates what's happening at a single point with the geometry of the larger space, which breaks down when you consider non-Cartesian coordinate systems (spherical, cylindrical etc) or when you get to General Relativity.    Embed Quote
