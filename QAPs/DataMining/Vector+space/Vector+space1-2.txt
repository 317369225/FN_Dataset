★What is the significance of a basis of a vector space?It is an independent subset of the vector space that spans the vector space. How this can be visualized physically or what are some different angles to see at a basis of a vector space.
Basis of a vector space can be thought of as a generalization of the cartesian co-ordinate system we use normally for 2 or 3 dimensional space. The coordinate of any vector we use the property that any vector can be represented as a unique linear combination of the basis vectors. In the cartesian coordinate system for two dimensional space the basis vectors are - (1,0) and (0,1). Any vector (a,b) can be represented as a unique linear combination of the two basis vectors - a * (1,0) + b * (0,1). It is important to note that the order of the basis vectors is used here to say that the coordinate of the vector is (a,b). We can do a change of basis bu changing the order of the basis vectors and then for the same vector the coordinate under new basis would be (b,a). In my opinion a lot of mathematics is developed by generalizing the concepts we use in high school. It distills out the assumptions we use implicitly and then apply the same to create abstract generic concepts.    Embed Quote
