★Can I get an intuitive explanation of a Vector Space Orientation?Right now, it all seems pretty abstract to me, and I'm trying to understand the use of a Jacobian Matrix/Determinant, so if you don't mind also expanding on that case, please do so! Thanks.
If you are orienting , you can view an orientation as choosing either a vector pointing directly out of the page, or a vector pointing directly into the page. (To connect this to the right hand rule, you can pick a basis of the vector space and take the vector pointing out of the page to be the cross product.) So by choosing a vector pointing out of the page, if you view as lying inside of , you have chosen "one side" of . A linear map is orientation preserving if the determinant is positive. A way to think of orientation preserving is that it doesn't "flip the page over". By flipping the page, I mean that if you colored the two sides different colors and thought about how you might tried to physically apply the transformation with your hands, you'd end up changing switching the sides. For example, the matrix (this is supposed to be 2 by 2) is a reflection, has negative determinant, and does "flip the page over" while a rotation matrix would have positive determinant, and would not flip the page over.    Embed Quote
