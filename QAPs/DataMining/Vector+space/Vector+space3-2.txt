★Linear Algebra: Why is the dimension of a vector space well-defined?The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis. But I can write down many different bases for a given vector space. How do I know that all such bases must have the same number of elements? (This question is part of my Technical Notes Project.)
First, let us observe that no space can be both -dimensional and -dimensional for . For the former means that its only element is zero, while the latter requires that it has a nonzero element. Next, note that, for any finite , the -th exterior power of a vector space with ordered basis itself has a basis given by the exterior products of ordered sequences of many elements of . Thus, the -th exterior power of an -dimensional space is itself -dimensional. Accordingly, if a space has finite dimension , it cannot also have dimension . For its -th exterior power would then have to have dimension both and . This shows that a space cannot have two different dimensions with at least one of them finite. To show that a space furthermore cannot have two different infinite dimensions is a trickier matter. In fact, for those who care about such things, this cannot be shown without some invocation of the axiom of choice (specifically, it is equivalent to the weak choice principle given by the ultrafilter lemma). However, I'll assume for now, as did everyone else, that you only really care about finite dimensions.    Embed Quote
