★What is the difference between a vector field and a vector space?
Suppose we have a manifold X.  (If you don't know what this is, examples of manifolds would include smooth curves, smooth surfaces, and the obvious higher-dimensional analogues thereof.) A vector bundle E of rank n on X is a choice of an n-dimensional vector space at each point of x, together with some geometric structure satisfying some conditions.  (These conditions basically dictate that relates in some way to the vector spaces at nearby points.)  So a vector bundle is a whole bunch of vector spaces which are "bundled together" via the added geometric structure.   A vector field is a choice of one vector in for each . So for instance we have the tangent bundle, which is a vector bundle that associates to each point the tangent space to each point.  A tangent field is a "continuous" (or "smooth," or something similar, depending on the exact context) choice of tangent vector to X at each point of X.    Embed Quote
