★Linear Algebra: In any vector space, what is the real difference between its spanning set and the basis? How do these differ? Please give some examples of a vector space where a spanning set can't be said to be the basis.
To give you the example you asked for, consider this.  For any vector space , itself is a spanning set of but is almost never going to be a basis.  Stated formally, for any vector space                                           If you understand what it means for a subset of a vector space to be a spanning set then the above statement should feel like a "oh, Duh!" moment.  If that's not the case, there's likely something off in your understanding of a spanning set!    Embed Quote
