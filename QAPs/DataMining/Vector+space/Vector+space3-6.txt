★Linear Algebra: Why is the dimension of a vector space well-defined?The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis. But I can write down many different bases for a given vector space. How do I know that all such bases must have the same number of elements? (This question is part of my Technical Notes Project.)
let {a1,a2...an} and {b1, b2 .... bm} be two set of basis for a given vector space with say n < m. So both sets have to be independent. our contention is that all of {b1, b2 .... bm} are not independent. Now let us find if we have a solution to the below equation: bn = c1b1 + c2b2 .....cnbn. Now since {a1,a2...an} is a base set, we cam easily expand b1 ...  bn+1 in terms of a1...an and prove that above equation does have a solution. Hence b1...bm m > n cant be a set of independent vectors.    Embed Quote
