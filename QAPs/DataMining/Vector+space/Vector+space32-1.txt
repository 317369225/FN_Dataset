★How can a Web search engine use the vector space model, TF/IDF, and PageRank altogether?
Different Learning to rank  methods are used by different search engines. Bing is said to be powered by RankNet algorithm. Basically, Learning to rank  methods can utilise  scores obtained from different search algorithms and provide better ranking. These methods are based on machine learning algorithms which  formulate  ranking as optimisation problem. The score of documents from  the PageRank , Vector Space Model, Language Model, Topic model etc  are  used as features to represent the documents. Hence, learning to rank can aggregate complementing techniques effectively. Besides score from information retrieval techniques other additional aspects of webpage for eg. length, language, authority score of author etc can also be used to rank the document. Following post  may give some basic idea about (RankSVM) one of the learning to rank methods. Support Vector Machines: What is the intuition for SVM-Rank and when should I use it?    Embed Quote
