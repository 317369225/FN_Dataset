★In linear algebra, when proving V is a vector space, instead of doing all of the ten properties, if V is closed under addition and is closed under scaler multiplication, can I stop there and say that V must be a vector space?Lets just say V is the set of all 2x2 matrices A=[a b 2b d](that is a 2 by 2 matrix). let + be standard addition and standard scalar multiplication .Can you please show me the simplest way to show if V is a vector space
If is a subset of another vector space and the operations on are inherited from the operations on then it is indeed enough to show that is closed under addition, scalar multiplication, and nonempty (in particular 0 is in ).  This is because all of the axioms for a vector space will still hold if the elements are only allowed to come from a subset of the given vector space. For example, lets check that satisfies that addition is commutative.  I'll be really pedantic with the notation, please forgive me.  Let .  Since , we also have .  Then , so the addition in is commutative. In other words, if a subset of a vector space is closed under the operations and nonempty then it is actually a vector space in its own right.  If you define a subspace to be a subset which is closed under the operations and nonempty then you can prove that that subset is a vector space; the proof is that you check all the axioms of a vector space in a completely analogous fashion to what I did above for commutativity of addition. In general, if you are trying to show something is a vector space but it is not a subset of something already known to be a vector space then you will have to verify all the axioms of a vector space.    Embed Quote
