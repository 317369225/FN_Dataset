★How do you prove a subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space is finite dimensional?
Background definitions and theorems: A basis of a vector space is a maximum linearly independent subset of it. Every vector space has a basis.  (It could be finite or infinite.) Every basis of a vector space has the same number of elements. The dimension a vector space is the number of elements in any of its bases. Every linearly independent subset of a vector space can be extended to a basis. Therefore, the number of elements in a linearly independent subset of a vector space is less than or equal to its dimension.Now suppose that you have a subspace W of a finite dimensional subspace V.  Let B be a basis of W. Then B is a linearly independent subset of W, so it's also a linearly independent subset of V. Hence the number of elements in B is less than or equal to the dimension of V. Therefore the dimension of W is less than or equal to the dimension of V.  But V is finite dimensional, so W is also finite dimensional.    Embed Quote
