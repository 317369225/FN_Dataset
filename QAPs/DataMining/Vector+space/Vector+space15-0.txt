★Set Theory: Alternate definition for a vector space?
What you've given is a definition of something like "vector space of dimension over the field , with a chosen (though perhaps we may ignore it) basis", where "basis" is understood in an infinitary sense. (Note: You claim that these will automatically have Hamel bases, but they needn't; you still need Choice to show that) One problem with this is that you've already ruled out such standard vector spaces as, for example, the space of eventually-zero sequences of elements of . (This is not ALL of the functions from to , but only some of them; there will be no way to make it match your definition, as your definition cannot produce spaces of countably infinite Hamel dimension). But even supposing we fixed that, an even more troubling problem with your definition is that it comes with that preferred basis, and forces us to only recognize vector spaces upon construction of such a basis. Much of the beauty of the theory of vector spaces is in the symmetries which are present when one lets go of the prejudices of supposing there to be a particular fixed preferred basis, and freeing oneself up to think more abstractly. There are a number of structures which act in basically the same way as other vector spaces for most purposes, but which come with no natural basis (and, indeed, needn't have a basis in the absence of choice), and therefore wouldn't be vector spaces under your definition, though they would on the standard definition. Here's another glaring example of a problem with such a style of definition, related to the previous one: it's nice to know that, given any vector space V which is a subspace of a vector space W, we can construct another vector space which is the quotient of W by modding out by V. Your definition does not make this obvious, and can only show this by appeal to Choice, while the standard definition makes it an obvious fact needing no Choice.    Embed Quote
