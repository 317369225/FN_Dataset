★Information Retrieval: Is the vector space model always superior to the Boolean model?
No. Information retrieval using the Boolean model is usually faster than using the vector space model. I believe that Boolean retrieval is a special case of the vector space model, so if you look at ranking accuracy only, the vector space gives better or equivalent results. Lucene's default scoring, for example, uses a hybrid approach: First filter the matching documents using a Boolean query, and then rank them using a version of the vector space model. This method is, most of the time, a good compromise between speed and accuracy.    Embed Quote
