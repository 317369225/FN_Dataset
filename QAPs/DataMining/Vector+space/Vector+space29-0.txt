★What intuitions about linear algebra do I need to discard when the vector space is over a field of finite characteristic?In information theory we often work with vector spaces over , and sometimes I become really confused when some theorem I'm really familiar with is incorrect for vector spaces over fields of characteristic 2. I'm also aware that char 2 fields are also special in their own way.
There is one big difference (that I can think of) between the finite fields and (in some sense, complex vector spaces are more natural to work with then real vector spaces, but that is a discussion for another time). The problem is that finite fields are not algebraically closed (indeed, in the case of , the equation has no solutions). This is important for at least two reasons: 1. If you have a characteristic polynomial of a matrix, you are no longer guaranteed that you can find all of its roots, and because of this: 2. You cannot apply Jordan normal form. You have to use a generalization, the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition. However, the notion of linear independence is still the same. Solving linear equations still works the same way. Gaussian elimination still works just fine (this is a big one, actually, since you can use for solving equations, finding inverses, obtaining LU decompositions, etc.). So, I guess what I would say is that the intuitions are essentially the same. However, the particular algorithms that you might want to apply may not work---you have to check that they do not assume algebraic closure, and that they do not assume that you can divide by 2 (in the case of ).    Embed Quote
