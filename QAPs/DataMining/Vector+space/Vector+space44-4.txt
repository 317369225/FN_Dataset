★Why is the matrix vector space written like R^(m×n)? For example, isn't a square 2x2 matrix really still contained in R^2?
If you think of as a vector of real numbers then is a vector where each element is itself a vector, IE a matrix thought of as a vector of rows or columns. It is a basic property of vector spaces that   is isomorphic to . If we are interpreting as integer multiplication, so specifying a square matrix as is abuse of notation. To be completely rigorous we would also need to specify the width of the rows. None the less as long as the reader understands the meaning of , it is permissible to specify a square matrix in that manner.    Embed Quote
