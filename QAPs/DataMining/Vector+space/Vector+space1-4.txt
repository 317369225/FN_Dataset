★What is the significance of a basis of a vector space?It is an independent subset of the vector space that spans the vector space. How this can be visualized physically or what are some different angles to see at a basis of a vector space.
A basis is a set that generates the vector space. More formally, given a basis for a vector space all elements of can be written uniquely as finite linear combinations of elements . Bases have the following nice property: if is a set function, then there is a unique linear map such that . In fact all subsets of having this property are bases. This property is extremely useful as it allows me to avoid dealing with the vector space and linear maps (which could be complicated) and allows me to deal only with the basis and set functions.    Embed Quote
