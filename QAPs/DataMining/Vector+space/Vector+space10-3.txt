★Mathematics: Is a topology and a vector space somehow related?Their definitions sound very similar- while one is defined in terms of vectors (their sums and product with constants), the other in terms of arbitrary unions and intersections. While one should contain the empty set and the whole set the topology is specified one, the other should contain the zero vector. Is it possible to also point out what their differences is, if they are not that related?
I think this may be the idea you are getting at. There is a way to make a vector space over the field out of the power set of a set. Let be a set and for all consider the operation , the Symmetric difference of the sets, as the vector addition. The additive identity is just the empty set, and every set is its own additive inverse. Multiplication by 1 is just the identity and by zero just sends any set to the empty set.  If we think of the vector or set A as being a string of 1s and 0s for each element of X where 1 means the element is in A and 0 means its not, then you can imagine as being where is the element wise XOR function. It's explained in the properties section of the linked wikipedia article. This structure makes the power set (or maybe some smaller algebra) into a vector space. It doesn't work for any general topology. The axioms of a topology are meant to generalize the geometric concept of having open space to roam around in in a set theoretic way and are very helpful in many other contexts (e.g. spaces of functions). They are not derived from some other well known algebraic structure.    Embed Quote
