★If I have a set of points in a vector space that I believe lie on a low dimensional manifold, what methods are useful for determining the dimensionality of that manifold?
If you want some principled methods to determine intrinsic dimensionality; the following papers are pretty good for point cloud data that lie on some lower dimensional manifold. Using an approximation that seems to capture all the signal energy or variance is a heuristic that would fail when the data is poorly approximated by principal components or the equivalent. Random Projections for Manifold Learning by Hedge and Baraniuk (this is better than ISOMAP for estimating intrinsic dimension) books.nips.cc/papers/files/nips20/NIPS2007_1100.pdf Random Projections on Smooth Manifolds by Wakin and Baraniuk http://portal.acm.org/citation.c...
