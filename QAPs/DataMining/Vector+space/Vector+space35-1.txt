★How can I prove that spans the entire vector space of functions ?
As Joachim pointed out, this isn't true in general. Guessing off the top of my head, the function is probably not in because it grows way too fast as . The Laplace transform is a linear transformation. Linear transformations can be thought of as a basis transformation when the transformation is invertible. Quick examples: the transformation that sends is not invertible. The image doesn't span the domain, so you can't think of this as transforming from one basis to another even though it's a linear transformation. So if you want to think of the Laplace transform as a basis transformation you must ask whether it is invertible. This turns out to depend heavily on what space you take as your domain. The domain space can't include rapidly growing functions like . And it only really makes sense to think about functions that have . But even for functions that have convergent Laplace transforms, how can we be sure that the transformation is invertible? That's a hard question that was answered with by several Mathematicians with the Inverse Laplace transform. Understanding why the inverse Laplace transform works requires understanding complex contour integration, but it's really nifty. Basically, there is a vector space of functions (not all functions!) (it's called or something) for which the Laplace transform is invertible. Then the inverse Laplace transform says that the functions span this space.    Embed Quote
