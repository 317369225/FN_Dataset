★What are the hot topics in machine learning and fuzzy logic together?
(A2A, Disclaimer: Not an expert in Fuzzy logic, self-promotion is ahead!) I am a researcher in Markov Logic Network(MLN). Markov logic is a generalization of First-Order logic, where each First-Order formula is attached with a weight. Hence instead of satisfying all the formulas we count the total weight of satisfied formulas (you can consider the weights as strength of each constraints, larger weight implies stricter constraints). The main challenge in MLN is to make it scalable. Our group (Vibhav Gogate's Research) is currently focusing on making inference more scalable. After tackling inference our next focus is to make learning scalable. Another emerging and cutting edge research area is combining Deep Learning with Statistical Relational Learning to make Deep Learning tractable. Pedro Domingos is currently focusing on this exciting new research area (Tractable Deep Learning). Finally if you really want to know latest work on Machine Learning/ Artificial Intelligence please follow the latest ML conferences. A few of them are mentioned below (not in any order) - NIPS : NIPS AI Statistics 2015 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence ICML Lille ECMLPKDD 2014 CONFERENCE Data Mining for Social Good PS: Do let me know if you have anything specific in your mind.    Embed Quote
