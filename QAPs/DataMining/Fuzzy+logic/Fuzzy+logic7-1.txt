★Why isn't fuzzy logic more widely taught?
Fuzzy Logic requires encoding information about the specific domain and the fuzzy qualifiers are not always obvious. In many ways Fuzzy logic is a special, semantically clearer but less flexible case of an expert system. But since these systems are often designed by programmers coming from outside the domain of application the clarity of a fuzzy syntax might lead to vaguer specifications or misunderstanding. IE: "slow the train if it is going too fast" is not amenable to a contract technical spec.. What i really find weird is why fuzzy databases didnt really catch on - these would help a lot with the variable quality of data.    Embed Quote
