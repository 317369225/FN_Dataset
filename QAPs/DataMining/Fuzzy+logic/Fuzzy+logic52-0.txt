★In fuzzy logic, can rules be evaluated when there are missing values?
It all depends on how the fuzzy engine is designed and its capabilities. For instance, in some engines you can have rules like 1
 If travelpurpose IS UNKNOWN ... or perhaps, if wildcards are allowed and correctly implemented, 1
2
3
 If travelpurpose IS ANY ... If travelpurpose IS NONE ... There are a few papers about the specific issue of missing data in fuzzy rules. For instance Fuzzy Process Model Development with Missing Data (behind a paywall); or Page on kops.uni-konstanz.de.    Embed Quote
