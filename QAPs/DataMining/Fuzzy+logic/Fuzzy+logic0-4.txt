★What's the point of fuzzy logic?
It is a somewhat pretentious and overhyped way to describe some pretty common-place techniques. Advocates of fuzzy logic set up a straw man that the only alternative is some naive binary ON-OFF / BANG-BANG simplicity. But it isn't... We routinely use analog signals, use feedback with differences, and have multiple quantised levels to represent analog signals. We routinely use weights and multiple factors. Fuzzy logic is just a way of describing that. It isn't even a very useful way to do so. If you use VLOOKUP in Excel to say "exam results between 80 and 90 are mapped to 'A' ; if you get three 'A's in a semester you get a merit" then that is the same technique as fuzzy logic Part of the fiction of fuzzy logic is that it is still coded in a non-fuzzy language on a non-fuxxy CPU, so it purely a verbal description. Or a piece of marketing spin if you prefer. "The old fashioned way is the way that the washing machine is on or off. With fuzzy logic we can have different states for a rinse wash, a normal wash, hot wash and a heavy soil wash". Whodathunkit... that never occurred to anyone before?    Embed Quote
