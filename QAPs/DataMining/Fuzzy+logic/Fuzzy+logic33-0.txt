★What are the applications of fuzzy logic in geology?
The obvious application from a layman's perspective is map-based prospecting for subterranean geologic features and resources on a small-pitch grid system. People do this manually through looking at maps and core sample reports, but that takes time and expensive expertise. I imagine there are also specialized (non-fuzzy) algorithms to do this, but why not use fuzzy to manage the complexity? IF a certain point on a map has particular surface characteristics AND is near other features A, B, and C, THEN there's a possibility that there's Unobtanium at a depth of D metres. With a good enough possibility, go digging.    Embed Quote
