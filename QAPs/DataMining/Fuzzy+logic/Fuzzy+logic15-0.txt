★What advantage does fuzzy logic have in rice cookers over conventional digital/sensor logic?I have long heard that rice cookers were one of the first practical applications for fuzzy logic, but I don't understand what makes fuzzy logic necessary.
The short answer is: none. Fuzzy logic can be emulated with conventional logic. Its main advantage is a different design process that some engineers find more convenient. While implementation size could have been an issue 20 years ago, even a small inexpensive chip now has far greater capabilities than needed for a high-end rice cooker.    Embed Quote
