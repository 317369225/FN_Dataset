★What can I take as a project that involves fuzzy logic and neural networks?We need to do 3 projects in a course in the span of 2 months. Firstly we need to build a fuzzy inference system. In second project we need to tackle some problem through the use of neural networks. Third project involves the combination of both neural networks and fuzzy logic. Please suggest the project topics. It would be convenient to us, if we have the same topic for all three.
The smartphones dataset from UCI: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set seems manageable enough to try to deduce rules regarding the activities of the subjects using fuzzy logic to later compare with NN. Finally, I would build a 'combined' classifier with the two approaches and compare.    Embed Quote
