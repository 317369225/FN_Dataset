★What's the point of fuzzy logic?
Fuzzy logic comes in very handy in the travel industry and is today mostly used by human travel agents. Here are a couple of examples: 1. Imagine an online booking site that asks: "Are you sure you want to spend 30,000 FF miles to get a ticket that would otherwise cost you $65 each way?" 2. What is your value of time? Suppose your value of time is $100 per hour. There's a non-stop flight for $1000 and there's a connecting flight with a 2-hour layover for $900. Obviously you wouldn't care for the connection. But what if the connection flight costs $800? Then you would probably be interested. And what if the connection flight costs $820? One of the biggest obstacles in the online travel industry is defining "the lowest price". Everyone seeks the lowest price, but we seek it only when it fits within a number of parameters. Some of these parameters might be specific and rock solid while some are amorphous and require prior knowledge of the traveler's preferences. An example might be "I'd like to stay in a nice hotel near the conference which has free wireless and a pool." In this case, the search algorithm knows it must search only for hotels that have free wireless and a pool but what about defining "nice" or "near"? That's where the fuzzy logic comes in.    Embed Quote
