★Where can I find someone fluent in fuzzy logic and matching algorithms?I'm starting a business and looking to contract the work or partner. I have several VCs and private investors interested, but I need a working beta before they will commit.
I work also with fuzzy matching.  Check out my posts on the Dice and Levenshtein algorithms for some fuzzy matching techniques (http://www.georgestragand.com/di... & http://www.georgestragand.com/le...).    Embed Quote
