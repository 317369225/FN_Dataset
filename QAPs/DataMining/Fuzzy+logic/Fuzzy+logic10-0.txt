★What are some good fuzzy logic libraries in Java?
There are some free libraries available...but when I've need to use one, in the end, I've implemented my own....But here is the short list, ordered by personal preference: - XFuzzy: Used to generate C code, has graphic interface for construction of control systems, new version(3.0) is in Java: Xfuzzy Home Page  - jFuzzyLogic: Works with Eclipse, never tried... jFuzzyLogic  - Fuzzy4j - new project, in active development, maybe worth a try... sorend / fuzzy4j - Bitbucket And if you are interested in type-2 Fuzzy Inference, the JT2FIS have been just lauched...here is the paper published in 2013: Manuel Castañón-Puga, Juan-Ramón Cutastro, Miguel Flores-Parra, JT2FIS: Java Type-2 Fuzzy Inference System - An Object-oriented Class Library for Building Java Intelligent Applications, ICEIS 2013 Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems. But no link to download was available. Hope it helps!!!    Embed Quote
