★Artificial Intelligence: How useful is fuzzy logic in designing AI?
Instead of needing fixed numbers to decide something, the A.I. can use numbers that are close enough. It's similar to the human mind. Whenever we see a face from a far distance we might at first believe it's someone else because the data that was inputted into our system was close enough. Our brain processed this information and told us that it was one of our friends, but as we get closer we realize that your assumption was incorrect. Fuzzy data allows A.I. to recognize images that are similar (both pictures of cups for example), and then predict what the image is even though the two pictures are different (one is a red tall cup, one is a blue small cup). There's no way we can save every picture of every type of cup, so fuzzy data your system to make an educated guess based on the data it receives.    Embed Quote
