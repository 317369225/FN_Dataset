★What is a simple worked out example of fuzzy logic?A worked out example would be highly appreciated.
Say I am looking at a "Glass getting filled". And I assign "1" for a full glass and "0" for an empty glass. Now I repeat the experiment of pouring arbitrary amount of water in the glass. At every instance I record the person's observation of whether the glass was full or not. So as the person observing this will be returning a random number between [0,1]. ( say 0.65 filled or 0.1 filled). Now, I have a set built, called the fuzzy set ( because It doesn't contain crisp values as 0 or 1 but values in [0,1]). There are several functions to build a fuzzy set (linear, sigmoid etc.). Now, after conducting the experiment, I want to establish a notion of "full or empty" and not "half full" or "quarter full". This is called converting a fuzzy set to crisp set. Now, I am establishing the notion of 0 or 1( crisp)  from [0,1] (fuzzy). To do this I perform an operation "lambda-cut". This lambda is a thresholding operator. When a fuzzy value is passed, this will return 0 if the value is less than the lambda else return 1. This operation de-fuzzifies the set. Now if you want to find a measure of how many times the glass was full in the whole set of experiments? You can count the 1's and divide it by the number of experiments. The output of this decision changes as your "lambda" value changes, as this varies the threshold.    Embed Quote
