★What are the coolest applications of fuzzy logic control systems?Can you give an example of how it's applied?
This depends only on your imagination! You can apply Fuzzy in almost everything, when you talking about control systems. In my opinion, a cool application to use fuzzy is in Electric motors control. For example, you have to control speed and the torque in which the motor will operate.    Embed Quote
