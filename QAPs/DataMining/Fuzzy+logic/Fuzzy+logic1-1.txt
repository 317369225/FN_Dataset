★Whatever happened to fuzzy logic?Back in the early 90's this was supposed to change the world.. And Japan was supposed to be lightyears ahead of us. Do Japanese rice cookers still use "neuro fuzzy" technology?
It's used all over the place. It was always overhyped, really.  It's only slightly different from a probability system for most purposes.  The advantage is that it more closely models common-sense relationships and you don't get effects based on the length of a proposition.  "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link" is a statement about fuzzy before fuzzy was called "fuzzy."    Embed Quote
