★What can I take as a project that involves fuzzy logic and neural networks?We need to do 3 projects in a course in the span of 2 months. Firstly we need to build a fuzzy inference system. In second project we need to tackle some problem through the use of neural networks. Third project involves the combination of both neural networks and fuzzy logic. Please suggest the project topics. It would be convenient to us, if we have the same topic for all three.
I think it will be interesting to tackle the same problem using these 3 approaches. Choose some learning problem in which the concept belongs to a numerical ordered range (e.g., income, expected life time). Then try to cope with the same problem given the 3 approaches. Use NN for predicting whether the concept is above certain threshold. Use fuzzy logic (how exactly you should use it?) in order to deduce rules regarding the concept. then you can use NN  to estimate the fuzzy concept or one of the rule you found. As for the topic it self, I recommend that you'll choose a topic that you find interesting. choose one where the features are numeric and you have large data set to avoid technical problems that might arise otherwise.    Embed Quote
