★What are the applications of fuzzy logic in civil engineering?
i did a project on perception of pedestrians where i had to work out on variance.  i had to go throw a lot of hardships with that topic, because 4 years of engineering and i never heard  about that, so i left that topic and worked on variance and all .. that is the only time when i heard about fuzzy logic in civil engineering.    Embed Quote
