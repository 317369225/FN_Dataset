★What is a cool fuzzy logic algorithm based project I can do on MATLAB?With all the fuss on evolutionary algorithms and NNs what are some cool projects I can implement on matlab using fuzzy methods?
Any automated system with a feedback loop. You can aggregate the command and the feedback using a fuzzy inference table. Given that there is an infinity of fuzzy operators, and an infinity of ways to tweak membership functions, that enables you to chose the inference system that will maximise speed, precision and stability. Fuzzy logic can also be implemented in any decision making problem that involves using thresholds, especially when they are arbitrary thresholds. Defining a fuzzy membership function near the threshold allows you to avoid outliers when running your algorithm with values that are close to the threshold. (For instance, in material selection software, you define crisp thresholds for the material properties you want to select in order to filter out all the materials under that threshold. If you were to use fuzzy threshold, there would be no risk of ruling out a solution that falls short of the threshold on one parameter, but is overall better)    Embed Quote
