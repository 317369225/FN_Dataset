★What's the point of fuzzy logic?
Often, EXACT equivalence is less valuable than "being in the neighborhood" for comparisons. Here's an example. - say you want to identify duplicate directories on your computer. If your tool identifies only directories that are EXACTLY copies of each other, that provides you with some value. However... what about a directory with one file just a LITTLE different than its counterpart in some other directory - but otherwise, all the other files are the same? That's fuzzy.  can you find those?  Some tools can, some can't.  Some can find some situations and not others. Here's what I'm talking about, in action: Paul Reiber's answer to Which Linux or Windows utility application helps to find duplicated folders? So... say a directory had a bunch of log data in it - a "pattern over time".  You could compare that directory to other ones to see what was a "match" and what wasn't. But... and EXACT match would be extremely rare.  The challenge of fuzzy logic is to come up with "close enough" matches. It's insanely useful for monitoring systems - for example, global-scale network management systems.  Fuzzy logic can be used to recognize "Hey... the same things are happening now, as happened an hour before <some catastrophe>!" That's a pretty cool thing for an AI system to figure out and share with someone.    Embed Quote
