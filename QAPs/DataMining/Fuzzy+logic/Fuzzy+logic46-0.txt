★Does the study of astronomy involve fuzzy logic?
A lot of things in astronomy involves fuzzy logic but not all. Not actually fuzzy but its the most probable explanations to some of the events. Like as for the big bang theory or the theories of multi verse they are just probabilities and can be said as fuzzy logics as there is no proof for them but we still believe its true.    Embed Quote
