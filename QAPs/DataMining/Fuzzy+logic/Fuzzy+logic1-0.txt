★Whatever happened to fuzzy logic?Back in the early 90's this was supposed to change the world.. And Japan was supposed to be lightyears ahead of us. Do Japanese rice cookers still use "neuro fuzzy" technology?
In many fields this approach is still widely used. For example in robotics there is a great number of projects based on fuzzy logic (you can search "fuzzy logic" words in IEEE Xplore browser - RAS and CIS - in order to find them). Personally I like much fuzzy logic approach and I wrote some international proceedings based on this technic. Perhaps it is not the Deus ex machina that everybody thought at the beginning of the 90's but for some real applications (like flexible manufacturing system using some robots arm and other devices) it is very useful.    Embed Quote
