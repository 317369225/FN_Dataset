★Lean Manufacturing: How can fuzzy logic be used to predict consumer purchasing?
Fuzzy Logic's "granular" qualities (integrates multiple variables and rules) make it a good way to collect the lived experience of marketers. Say you have access to a bunch of veteran buyers and salespeople. They're not MBAs, and Excel makes them turn pale. But, by heaven, they know how to move their one product. Your challenge is to distill and bottle their expertise ('cause management wants to replace them with interns, of course). But every time you ask for information, they launch into old war stories littered with little hints and tips but no real analytical value...in the traditional sense. Perhaps one says "Y'know, cardigans always sell well after an important person dies." A buyer remarks "Sheep farmers get desperate to sell wool after a wet spring". (I have no idea if these assertions are true.) In two sentences, you've got a wealth of linguistic variables and a valuable fuzzy rule or two STATE_FUNERAL: RECENT, DISTANT WOOL_PRICE: LOW, HIGH CARDIGAN_SALES: LOW, AVERAGE, HIGH if STATE_FUNERAL is RECENT and WOOL_PRICE is LOW then CARDIGAN_SALES are HIGH if STATE_FUNERAL is DISTANT and WOOL_PRICE is LOW then CARDIGAN_SALES are AVERAGE ...and defuzz for projected cardigan sales. Just lump together all the little tips you can find. If they repeat, repeat them. If they contradict each other, let them. Fuzzy integrates disparate facts and throws away anything that doesn't apply.    Embed Quote
