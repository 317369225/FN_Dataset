★What is the basic premise of fuzzy logic?Im looking for a simple explanation of how fuzzy logic works
Fuzzy logic is a fancy way of talking about various sorts of arithmetic one might do on the unit interval . In Boolean logic, one studies various operations on the two elements . For example, you might be interested in the functions , , and [which in this particular context also go by the names AND, OR, and NOT, respectively]. In fuzzy logic, one studies various operations on the unit interval instead. For example, you might be interested in the functions , , and [which in this particular context sometimes go by the names AND, OR, and NOT, respectively]. These are of course quite analogous to the identically named Boolean operations, though with somewhat different behavior in this context (for example, in the Boolean context, always equals and always equals ; in the unit interval, that's no longer necessarily true (for example, when )). For that matter, you might also be interested in other functions on the unit interval as well, with other analogies to traditional logical operations. Calling something "logic" is a way of highlighting its analogies with other things called "logic", but there's no concrete content to being granted such a name. It's just a perspective which can be useful. The concrete mathematical content of "fuzzy logic" is simply as the study of functions on , in exactly the same way as the concrete mathematical content of "Boolean logic" is simply as the study of functions on .    Embed Quote
