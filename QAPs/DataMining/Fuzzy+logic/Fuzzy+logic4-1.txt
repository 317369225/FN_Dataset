★What is the difference between fuzzy logic and probability?b'coz degrees of truth are often confused with probabilities.
I would like to answer my own question since now I have a better understanding. Yes, both fuzzy logic and probability theory are closely related, the key difference is their meaning. Probability is associated with events and not facts, and those events will either occur or not occur. There is nothing fuzzy about it. Where as in fuzzy logic we basically try to capture the essential concept of vagueness. Fuzzy Logic is all about degree of truth. Probability theory has nothing to reason about things that are't entirely true or false. In short, we can say that Fuzzy Logic captures the meaning of partial truth whereas Probability theory captures partial knowledge.    Embed Quote
