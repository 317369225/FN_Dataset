★Is there a relationship between category theory and fuzzy logic?
Yes. Topoi are the contraption which formalizes the notion of subobject classifiers. Subobject classification is the answer to the question "is x contained in X" for some element x and set X(using the appropriate notions of elements and sets). For me, one of the first fuzzy logic questions you want to think about is:         how can x be neither in, nor not in X? With a subobject classifier other than Z/2Z, you can have situations where x's inclusion is not a binary. This is a easy connection between the two. You should also take a spin through intuitionistic logic, how it relates to fuzzy logic, and how to think of it in category theory. A great resource on this stuff, although quite difficult and high level, is Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: A First Introduction to Topos Theory    Embed Quote
