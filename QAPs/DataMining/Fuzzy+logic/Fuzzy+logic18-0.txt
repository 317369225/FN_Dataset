★How is Fuzzy Logic used in game development?How can Fuzzy Logic be used in game design and development, especially in RTS games.
So, fuzzy logic is about membership, right? If over 6 feet equals tall and 5 foot 2 inches or less equals short (arbitrary example, calm down), then a person that is 5 feet 10 inched is mostly a member of tall and slightly a member of the group short.  All of the fuzzy magic happens between 0 and 1. So, let' s write some combat AI functions for NPC characters. First we'll write "find and use cover", then "attempt to flank", then we'll code up "target and fire", "surge forward", "go 90 degrees from team members" and "cover fire for team members". (BTW, these functions, when called, cast rays to find things and distances, evaluate enemy positions and cause the NPC to do a fixed behavior, if the evaluation equals 1) Next we will group the functions into 2 sets, cowardly and heroic. Cowardly contains cover, flank, go 90 and fire. Heroic contains cover, fire, surge and cover fire. Next we'll spawn some AI bad guys. They get a random membership value for the groups cowardly and heroic. One may be 90% heroic / 10% cowardly. The next may be 50/50 and so on. Let's say we spawn 10 of them and then throw in the PC. Now we have a shootout in a warehouse, with 10 AI bots versus the human player. Each AI will use the same few functions to create behaviors, but the fuzzy membership percentages will cause each bot to act differently. The most heroic may surge at the player while the most cowardly will use that distraction to attempt to flank, going from cover to cover. No two AI's will do the same thing. This is just one example. You could fuzzify path finding - direct/fast versus stealthy. You could randomize drops between armor, weapons and gold. Lots of variations are possible. The common idea is a variety of membership values for specific sets of dissimilar things to force a non-binary, gray area between zero and one.    Embed Quote
