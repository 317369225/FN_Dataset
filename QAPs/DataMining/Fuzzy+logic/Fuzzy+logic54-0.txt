★Is it right to say that Fuzzy Logic does not have sound mathematical footing?
No. Quoting a part from my answer to What's the point of fuzzy logic?: In classical logic, a truth assignment to a statement assigns it a value of either 0 or 1, whereas in fuzzy logic, the truth assignment is between 0 and 1 inclusive. In fuzzy logic, if and are any two statements, and is our truth assignment, we have the following properties: Note that the above properties are also satisfied for our classical proposition logic. In a sense, fuzzy logic is simply an extension of classical logic. Fuzzy logic, like rest of the areas in mathematics is based on axioms. It might seem counterintuitive, and even incorrect at times, but as long as it obeys the axioms we define, it's alright. Note 1: In case you by sound in your question, you were referring to soundness; proving that the axioms are consistent amongst themselves and prove only statements which are valid is what you mean by soundness of logic. In classical logic, it is not very hard to prove (by induction on height of proof trees) that the Hilbert system of axioms is sound, but the exact notion of soundness is not inherited by an equivalent system in fuzzy logic, and I can't fully answer your question due to lack of rigorous background in fuzzy logic. Note 2: In case you're interested in a formal article on fuzzy logic, check out Fuzzy Logic (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). A rigorous background in logic might be needed to be able to relate to fuzzy logic as an extension of classical logic, and understand it in this article.    Embed Quote
