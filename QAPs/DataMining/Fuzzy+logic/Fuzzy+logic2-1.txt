★What is the basic premise of fuzzy logic?Im looking for a simple explanation of how fuzzy logic works
Consider the following 3 animals. Robin Mouse Bat. Put a Robin on one side and a Mouse on the other side, where would you put the bat? Its like a Robin in that it flies and is somewhat bird like. On the other hand it looks a lot like a mouse. If I added a small rabbit, you would put that pretty close to the Mouse. They might be different sizes but you can see the similarities. Fuzzy logic is about the space in between. Its not that something is or isn't, its about degrees of belongingness.    Embed Quote
