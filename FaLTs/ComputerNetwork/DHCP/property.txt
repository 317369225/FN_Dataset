The base DHCP does not include any mechanism for authentication.[23] Because of this, it is vulnerable to a variety of attacks. These attacks fall into three main categories:

Unauthorized DHCP servers providing false information to clients.[24]
Unauthorized clients gaining access to resources.[24]
Resource exhaustion attacks from malicious DHCP clients.[24]
Because the client has no way to validate the identity of a DHCP server, unauthorized DHCP servers (commonly called "rogue DHCP") can be operated on networks, providing incorrect information to DHCP clients.[25] This can serve either as a denial-of-service attack, preventing the client from gaining access to network connectivity,[26] or as a man-in-the-middle attack.[27] Because the DHCP server provides the DHCP client with server IP addresses, such as the IP address of one or more DNS servers,[24] an attacker can convince a DHCP client to do its DNS lookups through its own DNS server, and can therefore provide its own answers to DNS queries from the client.[28][29] This in turn allows the attacker to redirect network traffic through itself, allowing it to eavesdrop on connections between the client and network servers it contacts, or to simply replace those network servers with its own.[28]

Because the DHCP server has no secure mechanism for authenticating the client, clients can gain unauthorized access to IP addresses by presenting credentials, such as client identifiers, that belong to other DHCP clients.[25] This also allows DHCP clients to exhaust the DHCP server's store of IP addresses¡ªby presenting new credentials each time it asks for an address, the client can consume all the available IP addresses on a particular network link, preventing other DHCP clients from getting service.[25]

DHCP does provide some mechanisms for mitigating these problems. The Relay Agent Information Option protocol extension (RFC 3046, usually referred to in the industry by its actual number as Option 82[30][31]) allows network operators to attach tags to DHCP messages as these messages arrive on the network operator's trusted network. This tag is then used as an authorization token to control the client's access to network resources. Because the client has no access to the network upstream of the relay agent, the lack of authentication does not prevent the DHCP server operator from relying on the authorization token.[23]

Another extension, Authentication for DHCP Messages (RFC 3118), provides a mechanism for authenticating DHCP messages. Unfortunately RFC 3118 has not seen (as of 2002) widespread adoption because of the problems of managing keys for large numbers of DHCP clients.[32] A 2007 book about DSL technologies remarked that "there were numerous security vulnerabilities identified against the security measures proposed by RFC 3118. This fact, combined with the introduction of 802.1x, slowed the deployment and take-rate of authenticated DHCP, and it has never been widely deployed."[33] A 2010 book notes that "[t]here have been very few implementations of DHCP Authentication. The challenges of key management and processing delays due to hash computation have been deemed too heavy a price to pay for the perceived benefits."[34]

More recent (2008) architectural proposals involve authenticating DHCP requests using 802.1x or PANA (both of which transport EAP).[35] An IETF proposal was made for including EAP in DHCP itself, the so-called EAPoDHCP;[36] this does not appear to have progressed beyond IETF draft level, the last of which dates to 2010.[37]
