The incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by using ingress filtering. It also makes it very difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin. As an alternative or augmentation of a DDoS, many attacks involve forging of IP sender addresses (IP address spoofing) also so that the location of the attacking machines cannot easily be identified and defeated.
