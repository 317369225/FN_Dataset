A given function or signal can be converted between the time and frequency domains with a pair of mathematical operators called a transform. An example is the Fourier transform, which converts the time function into a sum of sine waves of different frequencies, each of which represents a frequency component. The 'spectrum' of frequency components is the frequency domain representation of the signal. The inverse Fourier transform converts the frequency domain function back to a time function. A spectrum analyzer is the tool commonly used to visualize real-world signals in the frequency domain.

Some specialized signal processing techniques use transforms that result in a joint time¨Cfrequency domain, with the instantaneous frequency being a key link between the time domain and the frequency domain.
