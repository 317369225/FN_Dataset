From the 1960s onwards, user interaction with computers was primarily by means of command-line interfaces, initially on machines like the Teletype Model 33 ASR, but then on early CRT-based computer terminals such as the VT52.
All of these devices were purely text based, with no ability to display graphic or pictures.[2] For business application programs, text-based menus were used, but for more general interaction the command line was the interface.
From the early 1970s the Unix operating system on minicomputers pioneered the concept of a powerful command-line environment, which Unix called the "shell", with the ability to "pipe" the output of one command in as input to another, and to save and re-run strings of commands as "shell scripts" which acted like custom commands.
The command-line was also the main interface for the early home computers such as the Commodore PET, Apple II and BBC Micro ï¿½?almost always in the form of a BASIC interpreter. When more powerful business oriented microcomputers arrived with CP/M and later MSDOS computers such as the IBM PC, the command-line began to borrow some of the syntax and features of the Unix shells such as globbing and piping of output.
The command-line was first seriously challenged by the PARC GUI approach used in the 1983 Apple Lisa and the 1984 Apple Macintosh. The majority of IBM PC users did not replace their command.com shell with a GUI until Windows 95 was released in 1995.
