Gross bit rate: In digital communication systems, the physical layer gross bitrate,[5] raw bitrate,[6] data signaling rate,[7] gross data transfer rate[8] or uncoded transmission rate[6] (sometimes written as a variable Rb or fb  is the total number of physically transferred bits per second over a communication link, including useful data as well as protocol overhead.
Information rate: The term throughput, essentially the same thing as digital bandwidth consumption, denotes the achieved average useful bit rate in a computer network over a logical or physical communication link or through a network node, typically measured at a reference point above the datalink layer. This implies that the throughput often excludes data link layer protocol overhead. The throughput is affected by the traffic load from the data source in question, as well as from other sources sharing the same network resources. See also measuring network throughput.
Goodput (data transfer rate): Goodput or data transfer rate refers to the achieved average net bit rate that is delivered to the application layer, exclusive of all protocol overhead, data packets retransmissions, etc. For example, in the case of file transfer, the goodput corresponds to the achieved file transfer rate. The file transfer rate in bit/s can be calculated as the file size (in bytes) divided by the file transfer time (in seconds) and multiplied by eight.
