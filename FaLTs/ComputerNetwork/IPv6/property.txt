PPP was designed somewhat after the original HDLC specifications. The designers of PPP included many additional features that had been seen only in proprietary data-link protocols up to that time.
RFC 2516 describes Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE) as a method for transmitting PPP over Ethernet that is sometimes used with DSL. RFC 2364 describes Point-to-Point Protocol over ATM (PPPoA) as a method for transmitting PPP over ATM Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5), which is also a common alternative to PPPoE used with DSL.
PPP is specified in RFC 1661.
Features of SCTP include:
Multihoming support in which one or both endpoints of a connection can consist of more than one IP address, enabling transparent fail-over between redundant network paths. Delivery of chunks within independent streams eliminate unnecessary head-of-line blocking, as opposed to TCP byte-stream delivery. Path selection and monitoring select a primary data transmission path and test the connectivity of the transmission path. Validation and acknowledgment mechanisms protect against flooding attacks and provide notification of duplicated or missing data chunks. Improved error detection suitable for Ethernet jumbo frames.
The designers of SCTP originally intended it for the transport of telephony (Signaling System 7) over Internet Protocol, with the goal of duplicating some of the reliability attributes of the SS7 signaling network in IP. This IETF effort is known as SIGTRAN. In the meantime, other uses have been proposed, for example, the Diameter protocol[4] and Reliable server pooling (RSerPool).[5]
