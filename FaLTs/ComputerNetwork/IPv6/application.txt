In conjunction with PPTP to create VPNs. In conjunction with IPsec VPNs to allow passing of routing information between connected networks. In Mobility protocols. In A8/A10 interfaces to encapsulate IP data to/from Packet Control Function (PCF). Linux and BSD can establish ad-hoc IP over GRE tunnels which are interoperable with Cisco equipment. Aruba Access Points use GRE tunnels to establish a connection with their respective Aruba Mobility Controller. User data is transferred through this tunnel.

PPPoE hoped to merge the widespread Ethernet infrastructure with the ubiquitous PPP, allowing vendors on both sides of the connection to heavily leverage their existing software and deliver products in the very near term. Essentially all operating systems at the time had a PPP stack, and the design of PPPoE allowed for a simple shim at the line-encoding stage to convert from PPP to PPPoE.
