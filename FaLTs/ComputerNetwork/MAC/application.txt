The following network technologies use the MAC-48 identifier format:

Ethernet
802.11 wireless networks
Bluetooth
IEEE 802.5 token ring
most other IEEE 802 networks
Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI)
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), switched virtual connections only, as part of an NSAP address
Fibre Channel and Serial Attached SCSI (as part of a World Wide Name)
The ITU-T G.hn standard, which provides a way to create a high-speed (up to 1 gigabit/s) local area network using existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables). The G.hn Application Protocol Convergence (APC) layer accepts Ethernet frames that use the MAC-48 format and encapsulates them into G.hn Medium Access Control Service Data Units (MSDUs).
Every device that connects to an IEEE 802 network (such as Ethernet and WiFi) has a MAC-48 address. Common networked consumer devices such as PCs, smartphones and tablet computers use MAC-48 addresses.

EUI-64 identifiers are used in:

IEEE 1394 (FireWire)
IPv6 (Modified EUI-64 as the least-significant 64 bits of a unicast network address or link-local address when stateless autoconfiguration is used)
ZigBee / 802.15.4 / 6LoWPAN wireless personal-area networks
