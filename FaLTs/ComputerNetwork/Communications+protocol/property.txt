Integrity - RSVP messages are appended with a message digest created by combining the message contents and a shared key using a message digest algorithm (commonly MD5). The key can be distributed and confirmed using 2 message types: integrity challenge request and integrity challenge response. Error reporting - when a node detects an error, an error message is generated with an error code and is propagated upstream on the reverse path to the sender. Information on RSVP flow - two types of diagnostic messages allow a network operator to request the RSVP state information on a specific flow. Diagnostic facility - An extension to the standard which allows a user to collect information about the RSVP state along a path. RFC2745 - RSVP Diagnostic Messages
Features of SCTP include:
Multihoming support in which one or both endpoints of a connection can consist of more than one IP address, enabling transparent fail-over between redundant network paths. Delivery of chunks within independent streams eliminate unnecessary head-of-line blocking, as opposed to TCP byte-stream delivery. Path selection and monitoring select a primary data transmission path and test the connectivity of the transmission path. Validation and acknowledgment mechanisms protect against flooding attacks and provide notification of duplicated or missing data chunks. Improved error detection suitable for Ethernet jumbo frames.
The designers of SCTP originally intended it for the transport of telephony (Signaling System 7) over Internet Protocol, with the goal of duplicating some of the reliability attributes of the SS7 signaling network in IP. This IETF effort is known as SIGTRAN. In the meantime, other uses have been proposed, for example, the Diameter protocol[4] and Reliable server pooling (RSerPool).[5]
