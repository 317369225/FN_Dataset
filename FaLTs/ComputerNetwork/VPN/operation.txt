VoIP can be a benefit for reducing communication and infrastructure costs. Examples include:
Routing phone calls over existing data networks to avoid the need for separate voice and data networks.[14] The ability to transmit more than one telephone call over a single broadband connection. Secure calls using standardized protocols (such as Secure Real-time Transport Protocol). Most of the difficulties of creating a secure telephone connection over traditional phone lines, such as digitizing and digital transmission, are already in place with VoIP. It is only necessary to encrypt and authenticate the existing data stream.
