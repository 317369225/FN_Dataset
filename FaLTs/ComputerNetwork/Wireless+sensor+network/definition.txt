Wireless sensor networks (WSN), are similar to wireless ad hoc networks in the sense that they rely on wireless connectivity and spontaneous formation of networks so that sensor data can be transported wirelessly. Sometimes they are called dust networks, referring to minute sensors as small as dust.
