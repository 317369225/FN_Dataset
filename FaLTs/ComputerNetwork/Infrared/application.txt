A commonly used sub-division scheme is:[6]
Division Name Abbreviation Wavelength Photon Energy Characteristics Near-infrared NIR, IR-A DIN 0.75-1.4 µm 0.9-1.7 eV Defined by the water absorption, and commonly used in fiber optic telecommunication because of low attenuation losses in the SiO2 glass (silica) medium. Image intensifiers are sensitive to this area of the spectrum. Examples include night vision devices such as night vision goggles. Short-wavelength infrared SWIR, IR-B DIN 1.4-3 µm 0.4-0.9 eV Water absorption increases significantly at 1,450 nm. The 1,530 to 1,560 nm range is the dominant spectral region for long-distance telecommunications. Mid-wavelength infrared MWIR, IR-C DIN; MidIR.[7] Also called intermediate infrared (IIR) 3-8 µm 150-400 meV In guided missile technology the 3-5 µm portion of this band is the atmospheric window in which the homing heads of passive IR 'heat seeking' missiles are designed to work, homing on to the Infrared signature of the target aircraft, typically the jet engine exhaust plume Long-wavelength infrared LWIR, IR-C DIN 8�?5 µm 80-150 meV This is the "thermal imaging" region, in which sensors can obtain a completely passive picture of the outside world based on thermal emissions only and requiring no external light or thermal source such as the sun, moon or infrared illuminator. Forward-looking infrared (FLIR) systems use this area of the spectrum. This region is also called the "thermal infrared." Far infrared FIR 15 - 1,000 µm 1.2-80 meV (see also far-infrared laser and far infrared).
NIR and SWIR is sometimes called "reflected infrared" while MWIR and LWIR is sometimes referred to as "thermal infrared." Due to the nature of the blackbody radiation curves, typical 'hot' objects, such as exhaust pipes, often appear brighter in the MW compared to the same object viewed in the LW.
