NFC allows one- and two-way communication between endpoints, suitable for many applications.

Commerce[edit]
NFC devices can be used in contactless payment systems, similar to those used in credit cards and electronic ticket smartcards and allow mobile payment to replace/supplement these systems.

In Android 4.4, Google introduced platform support for secure NFC-based transactions through Host Card Emulation (HCE), for payments, loyalty programs, card access, transit passes and other custom services. HCE allows any Android 4.4 app to emulate an NFC smart card, letting users initiate transactions with their device. Apps can use a new Reader Mode to act as readers for HCE cards and other NFC-based transactions.

On September 9, 2014, Apple announced support for NFC-powered transactions as part of Apple Pay.[53] With the introduction of iOS 11, Apple devices allow third-party developers to read data from NFC tags.[54]

Bootstrapping other connections[edit]
NFC offers a low-speed connection with simple setup that can be used to bootstrap more capable wireless connections.[3] For example, Android Beam software uses NFC to enable pairing and establish a Bluetooth connection when doing a file transfer and then disabling Bluetooth on both devices upon completion.[55] Nokia, Samsung, BlackBerry and Sony[56] have used NFC technology to pair Bluetooth headsets, media players and speakers with one tap.[citation needed] The same principle can be applied to the configuration of Wi-Fi networks. Samsung Galaxy devices have a feature named S-Beam¡ªan extension of Android Beam that uses NFC (to share MAC Address and IP addresses) and then uses Wi-Fi Direct to share files and documents. The advantage of using Wi-Fi Direct over Bluetooth is that it permits much faster data transfers, running up to 300Mbit/s.[34]

Social networking[edit]
NFC can be used for social networking, for sharing contacts, photos, videos or files[2] and entering multiplayer mobile games.[57]

Identity and access tokens[edit]
NFC-enabled devices can act as electronic identity documents and keycards.[3] NFC's short range and encryption support make it more suitable than less private RFID systems.

Smartphone automation and NFC tags[edit]
NFC-equipped smartphones can be paired with NFC Tags or stickers that can be programmed by NFC apps. These programs can allow a change of phone settings, texting, app launching, or command execution.

Such apps do not rely on a company or manufacturer, but can be utilized immediately with an NFC-equipped smartphone and an NFC tag.[58]

The NFC Forum published the Signature Record Type Definition (RTD) 2.0 in 2015 to add integrity and authenticity for NFC Tags. This specification allows an NFC device to verify tag data and identify the tag author.[59]

Gaming[edit]

NFC was used in video games starting with Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure.[citation needed] With it you buy figurines that are customizable and contain personal data with each figure, so no two figures are exactly alike. The Wii U was the first system to include NFC technology out of the box via the GamePad. It was later included in the Nintendo 3DS range (being built into the New Nintendo 3DS/XL and in a separately sold reader which uses Infrared to communicate to the system). The Amiibo range of accessories utilizes NFC technology to unlock features.
