Time-division multiplexing was first developed in telegraphy; see multiplexing in telegraphy: Ã‰mile Baudot developed a time-multiplexing system of multiple Hughes machines in the 1870s.

In 1953 a 24-channel TDM was placed in commercial operation by RCA Communications to send audio information between RCA's facility at Broad Street, New York and their transmitting station at Rocky Point and the receiving station at Riverhead, Long Island, New York. The communication was by a microwave system throughout Long Island. The experimental TDM system was developed by RCA Laboratories between 1950 and 1953.[1]
In 1962, engineers from Bell Labs developed the first D1 Channel Banks, which combined 24 digitised voice calls over a 4-wire copper trunk between Bell central office analogue switches. A channel bank sliced a 1.544 Mbit/s digital signal into 8,000 separate frames, each composed of 24 contiguous bytes. Each byte represented a single telephone call encoded into a constant bit rate signal of 64 Kbit/s. Channel banks used a byte's fixed position (temporal alignment) in the frame to determine which call it belonged to.[2]
