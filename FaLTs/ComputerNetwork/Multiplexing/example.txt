An example of four mutually orthogonal digital signals.
Start with a set of vectors that are mutually orthogonal. (Although mutual orthogonality is the only condition, these vectors are usually constructed for ease of decoding, for example columns or rows from Walsh matrices.) An example of orthogonal functions is shown in the picture on the left. These vectors will be assigned to individual users and are called the code, chip code, or chipping code. In the interest of brevity, the rest of this example uses codes, v, with only 2 bits.
Each user is associated with a different code, say v. A 1 bit is represented by transmitting a positive code, v, and a 0 bit is represented by a negative code, �?b>v. For example, if v = (v0, v1) = (1, �?) and the data that the user wishes to transmit is (1, 0, 1, 1), then the transmitted symbols would be (v, �?b>v, v, v) = (v0, v1, –v0, –v1, v0, v1, v0, v1) = (1, �?, �?, 1, 1, �?, 1, �?). For the purposes of this article, we call this constructed vector the transmitted vector.
Each sender has a different, unique vector v chosen from that set, but the construction method of the transmitted vector is identical.
Now, due to physical properties of interference, if two signals at a point are in phase, they add to give twice the amplitude of each signal, but if they are out of phase, they subtract and give a signal that is the difference of the amplitudes. Digitally, this behaviour can be modelled by the addition of the transmission vectors, component by component.
If sender0 has code (1, �?) and data (1, 0, 1, 1), and sender1 has code (1, 1) and data (0, 0, 1, 1), and both senders transmit simultaneously, then this table describes the coding steps:
Step Encode sender0 Encode sender1 0 code0 = (1, �?), data0 = (1, 0, 1, 1) code1 = (1, 1), data1 = (0, 0, 1, 1) 1 encode0 = 2(1, 0, 1, 1) �?(1, 1, 1, 1) = (1, �?, 1, 1) encode1 = 2(0, 0, 1, 1) �?(1, 1, 1, 1) = (�?, �?, 1, 1) 2 signal0 = encode0 �?code0 = (1, �?, 1, 1) �?(1, �?) = (1, �?, �?, 1, 1, �?, 1, �?) signal1 = encode1 �?code1 = (�?, �?, 1, 1) �?(1, 1) = (�?, �?, �?, �?, 1, 1, 1, 1)
Because signal0 and signal1 are transmitted at the same time into the air, they add to produce the raw signal:
(1, �?, �?, 1, 1, �?, 1, �?) + (�?, �?, �?, �?, 1, 1, 1, 1) = (0, �?, �?, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0)
This raw signal is called an interference pattern. The receiver then extracts an intelligible signal for any known sender by combining the sender's code with the interference pattern, the receiver combines it with the codes of the senders. The following table explains how this works and shows that the signals do not interfere with one another:
Step Decode sender0 Decode sender1 0 code0 = (1, �?), signal = (0, �?, �?, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0) code1 = (1, 1), signal = (0, �?, �?, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0) 1 decode0 = pattern.vector0 decode1 = pattern.vector1 2 decode0 = ((0, �?), (�?, 0), (2, 0), (2, 0)).(1, �?) decode1 = ((0, �?), (�?, 0), (2, 0), (2, 0)).(1, 1) 3 decode0 = ((0 + 2), (�? + 0), (2 + 0), (2 + 0)) decode1 = ((0 �?2), (�? + 0), (2 + 0), (2 + 0)) 4 data0=(2, �?, 2, 2), meaning (1, 0, 1, 1) data1=(�?, �?, 2, 2), meaning (0, 0, 1, 1)
Further, after decoding, all values greater than 0 are interpreted as 1 while all values less than zero are interpreted as 0. For example, after decoding, data0 is (2, �?, 2, 2), but the receiver interprets this as (1, 0, 1, 1). Values of exactly 0 means that the sender did not transmit any data, as in the following example:
Assume signal0 = (1, �?, �?, 1, 1, �?, 1, �?) is transmitted alone. The following table shows the decode at the receiver:
Step Decode sender0 Decode sender1 0 code0 = (1, �?), signal = (1, �?, �?, 1, 1, �?, 1, �?) code1 = (1, 1), signal = (1, �?, �?, 1, 1, �?, 1, �?) 1 decode0 = pattern.vector0 decode1 = pattern.vector1 2 decode0 = ((1, �?), (�?, 1), (1, �?), (1, �?)).(1, �?) decode1 = ((1, �?), (�?, 1), (1, �?), (1, �?)).(1, 1) 3 decode0 = ((1 + 1), (�? �?1),(1 + 1), (1 + 1)) decode1 = ((1 �?1), (�? + 1),(1 �?1), (1 �?1)) 4 data0 = (2, �?, 2, 2), meaning (1, 0, 1, 1) data1 = (0, 0, 0, 0), meaning no data
When the receiver attempts to decode the signal using sender1's code, the data is all zeros, therefore the cross correlation is equal to zero and it is clear that sender1 did not transmit any data.

TDM can be further extended into the time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, where several stations connected to the same physical medium, for example sharing the same frequency channel, can communicate. Application examples include:
