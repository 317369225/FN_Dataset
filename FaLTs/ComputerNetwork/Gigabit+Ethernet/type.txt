Most storage networks use the SCSI protocol for communication between servers and disk drive devices. A mapping layer to other protocols is used to form a network:
ATA over Ethernet (AoE), mapping of ATA over Ethernet Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP), the most prominent one, is a mapping of SCSI over Fibre Channel Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) ESCON over Fibre Channel (FICON), used by mainframe computers HyperSCSI, mapping of SCSI over Ethernet iFCP[2] or SANoIP[3] mapping of FCP over IP iSCSI, mapping of SCSI over TCP/IP iSCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER), mapping of iSCSI over InfiniBand
Storage networks may also be built using SAS and SATA technologies. SAS evolved from SCSI direct-attached storage. SATA evolved from IDE direct-attached storage. SAS and SATA devices can be networked using SAS Expanders.
Early data networks allowed VPN-style remote connectivity through dial-up modems or through leased line connections utilizing Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) virtual circuits provisioned through a network owned and operated by telecommunication carriers such as AT&T or Verizon. These networks are not considered true VPNs because they passively secure the data being transmitted by the creation of logical data streams.[3] They have given way to VPNs based on IP and IP/Multi-protocol Label Switching Networks (MPLS) based VPNs due to significant cost-reductions and increased bandwidth [4] provided by new technologies such as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) [5] and fiber-optic networks.
VPNs can be either remote-access (connecting an individual computer to a network) or site-to-site (connecting two networks together). In a corporate setting, remote-access VPNs allow employees to access their company's intranet from home or while traveling outside the office, and site-to-site VPNs allow employees in geographically separated offices to share one cohesive virtual network. A VPN can also be used to interconnect two similar networks over a dissimilar middle network; for example, two IPv6 networks over an IPv4 network.[6]
VPN systems can be classified by:
the protocols used to tunnel the traffic the tunnel's termination point, i.e., customer edge or network-provider edge whether they offer site-to-site or remote-access connectivity the levels of security provided the OSI layer they present to the connecting network, such as Layer 2 circuits or Layer 3 network connectivity
