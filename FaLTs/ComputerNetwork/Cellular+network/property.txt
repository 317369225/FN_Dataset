The following key features can be observed in all suggested 4G technologies:
Physical layer transmission techniques are as follows:[30] MIMO: To attain ultra high spectral efficiency by means of spatial processing including multi-antenna and multi-user MIMO Frequency-domain-equalization, for example multi-carrier modulation (OFDM) in the downlink or single-carrier frequency-domain-equalization (SC-FDE) in the uplink: To exploit the frequency selective channel property without complex equalization Frequency-domain statistical multiplexing, for example (OFDMA) or (single-carrier FDMA) (SC-FDMA, a.k.a. linearly precoded OFDMA, LP-OFDMA) in the uplink: Variable bit rate by assigning different sub-channels to different users based on the channel conditions Turbo principle error-correcting codes: To minimize the required SNR at the reception side Channel-dependent scheduling: To use the time-varying channel Link adaptation: Adaptive modulation and error-correcting codes Mobile-IP utilized for mobility IP-based femtocells (home nodes connected to fixed Internet broadband infrastructure)
As opposed to earlier generations, 4G systems do not support circuit switched telephony. IEEE 802.20, UMB and OFDM standards[31] lack soft-handover support, also known as cooperative relaying.
