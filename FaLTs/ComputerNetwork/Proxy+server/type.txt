In a general network environment the following types of servers may be found.

Standalone server, an emulator for client–server (web-based) programs Web server, a server that HTTP clients connect to in order to send commands and receive responses along with data contents
Almost the entire structure of the Internet is based upon a client–server model. High-level root nameservers, DNS, and routers direct the traffic on the internet. There are millions of servers connected to the Internet, running continuously throughout the world.
World Wide Web Domain Name System E-mail FTP file transfer Chat and instant messaging Voice communication Streaming audio and video Online gaming Database servers
Virtually every action taken by an ordinary Internet user requires one or more interactions with one or more servers.
There are also technologies that operate on an inter-server level. Other services do not use dedicated servers; for example peer-to-peer file sharing, some implementations of telephony (e.g. Skype), and supplying television programs to several users (e.g. Kontiki, SlingBox).
