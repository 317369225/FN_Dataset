The current opinion is that the efficiency of good implementations of simplex-based methods and interior point methods are similar for routine applications of linear programming.[14] However, for specific types of LP problems, it may be that one type of solver is better than another (sometimes much better).
LP solvers are in widespread use for optimization of various problems in industry, such as optimization of flow in transportation networks.[15]
