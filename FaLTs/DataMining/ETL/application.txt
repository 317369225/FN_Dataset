By using an established ETL framework, one may increase one's chances of ending up with better connectivity and scalability.[citation needed] A good ETL tool must be able to communicate with the many different relational databases and read the various file formats used throughout an organization. ETL tools have started to migrate into Enterprise Application Integration, or even Enterprise Service Bus, systems that now cover much more than just the extraction, transformation, and loading of data. Many ETL vendors now have data profiling, data quality, and metadata capabilities. A common use case for ETL tools include converting CSV files to formats readable by relational databases. A typical translation of millions of records is facilitated by ETL tools that enable users to input csv-like data feeds/files and import it into a database with as little code as possible.

ETL tools are typically used by a broad range of professionals - from students in computer science looking to quickly import large data sets to database architects in charge of company account management, ETL tools have become a convenient tool that can be relied on to get maximum performance. ETL tools in most cases contain a GUI that helps users conveniently transform data, using a visual data mapper, as opposed to writing large programs to parse files and modify data types.

While ETL Tools have traditionally been for developers and I.T. staff, the new trend is to provide these capabilities to business users so they can themselves create connections and data integrations when needed, rather than going to the I.T. staff.[6] Gartner refers to these non-technical users as Citizen Integrators.[7]
