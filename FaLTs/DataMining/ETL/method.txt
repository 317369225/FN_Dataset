The typical real-life ETL cycle consists of the following execution steps:

Cycle initiation
Build reference data
Extract (from sources)
Validate
Transform (clean, apply business rules, check for data integrity, create aggregates or disaggregates)
Stage (load into staging tables, if used)
Audit reports (for example, on compliance with business rules. Also, in case of failure, helps to diagnose/repair)
Publish (to target tables)
