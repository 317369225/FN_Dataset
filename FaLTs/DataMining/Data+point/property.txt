The measurements contained in a data point are formally typed, where here type is used in a way compatible with datatype in computing; so that the type of measurement can specify whether the measurement results in a Boolean value from {yes, no}, an integer or real number, the identity of some category, or some vector or array.

The implication of point is often that the data may be plotted in a graphic display, but in many cases the data are processed numerically before that is done. In the context of statistical graphics, measured values for individuals or summary statistics for different subpopulations are displayed as separate symbols within a display; since such symbols can differ by shape, size and colour, a single data point within a display can convey multiple aspects of the set of measurements for an individual or subpopulation.
