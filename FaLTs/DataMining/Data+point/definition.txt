In statistics, a data point or observation is a set of one or more measurements on a single member of a statistical population. For example, in a study of the determinants of money demand with the unit of observation being the individual, a data point might be the values of income, wealth, age of individual, number of dependents. Statistical inference about the population would be conducted using a statistical sample consisting of various such data points.
