The term "k-means" was first used by James MacQueen in 1967,[1] though the idea goes back to Hugo Steinhaus in 1957.[2] The standard algorithm was first proposed by Stuart Lloyd in 1957 as a technique for pulse-code modulation, though it wasn't published outside Bell labs until 1982.[3] In 1965, E.W.Forgy published essentially the same method, which is why it is sometimes referred to as Lloyd-Forgy, too.[4] A more efficient version was proposed and published in Fortran by Hartigan and Wong in 1975/1979.[5][6]
