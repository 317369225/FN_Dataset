It can be understood as an emergent property from the synergies among: 1) data-information-knowledge; 2) software-hardware; and 3) experts (those with new insights as well as recognized authorities) that continually learns from feedback to produce just-in-time knowledge for better decisions than these three elements acting alone.[2] Or more narrowly as an emergent property between people and ways of processing information.[3] This notion of collective intelligence is referred to as "symbiotic intelligence" by Norman Lee Johnson.[4] The concept is used in sociology, business, computer science and mass communications: it also appears in science fiction. Pierre L¨¦vy defines collective intelligence as, "It is a form of universally distributed intelligence, constantly enhanced, coordinated in real time, and resulting in the effective mobilization of skills. I'll add the following indispensable characteristic to this definition: The basis and goal of collective intelligence is mutual recognition and enrichment of individuals rather than the cult of fetishized or hypostatized communities."[5] According to researchers Pierre L¨¦vy and Derrick de Kerckhove, it refers to capacity of networked ICTs (Information communication technologies) to enhance the collective pool of social knowledge by simultaneously expanding the extent of human interactions.
