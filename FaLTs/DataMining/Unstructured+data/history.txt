The earliest research into business intelligence focused in on unstructured textual data, rather than numerical data.[1] As early as 1958, computer science researchers like H.P. Luhn were particularly concerned with the extraction and classification of unstructured text.[1] However, only since the turn of the century has the technology caught up with the research interest. In 2004, the SAS Institute developed the SAS Text Miner, which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce a hyper-dimensional textual space into smaller dimensions for significantly more efficient machine-analysis.[2] The mathematical and technological advances sparked by machine textual analysis prompted a number of business to research applications, leading to the development of fields like sentiment analysis, voice of the customer mining, and call center optimization.[3] The emergence of Big Data in the late 2000s led to a heightened interest in the applications of unstructured data analytics in contemporary fields such as predictive analytics and root cause analysis.[4]
