In modern management usage, one can easily discern a trend away from the term "data" in composite expressions to the term "information" or even "knowledge" when talking in a non-technical context. Thus there exists not only data management, but also information management and knowledge management. This is a misleading trend as it obscures that traditional data are managed or somehow processed on second looks.[citation needed] The distinction between data and derived values can be seen in the information ladder.[citation needed] While data can exist as such, "information" and "knowledge" are always in the "eye" (or rather the brain) of the beholder and can only be measured in relative units. However, data has staged a comeback with the popularisation of the term Big_data, which refers to the collection and analyses of very large sets of data, to interpret and predict.

Several organisations have established a data management centre (DMC)[4] for their operations.
