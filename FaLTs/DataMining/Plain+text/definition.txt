In computing, plain text is the data (e.g. file contents) that represent only characters of readable material but not its graphical representation nor other objects (images, etc.). It may also include a limited number of characters that control simple arrangement of text, such as line breaks or tabulation characters. Plain text is different from formatted text, where style information is included, and from "binary files" in which some portions must be interpreted as binary objects (encoded integers, real numbers, images, etc.).
The Unicode definition of plain text:

"Plain text represents the basic, interchangeable content of text."
"Plain text represents character content only, not its appearance."
"It can be displayed in a variety of ways and requires a rendering process to make it visible with a particular appearance."
"If the same plain text sequence is given to disparate rendering processes, there is no expectation that rendered text in each instance should have the same appearance."
"Instead, the disparate rendering processes are simply required to make the text legible according to the intended reading."
"This legibility criterion constrains the range of possible appearances."
"The relationship between appearance and content of plain text may be summarized as follows: Plain text must contain enough information to permit the text to be rendered legibly, and nothing more."
"The Unicode Standard encodes plain text."
"The distinction between plain text and other forms of data in the same data stream is the function of a higher-level protocol and is not specified by the Unicode Standard itself."[3]
