Suppose we have a set of observable random variables, with means .
Suppose for some unknown constants and unobserved random variables , where and , where , we have

Here, the are independently distributed error terms with zero mean and finite variance, which may not be the same for all . Let , so that we have

In matrix terms, we have

If we have observations, then we will have the dimensions , , and . Each column of and denote values for one particular observation, and matrix does not vary across observations.
Also we will impose the following assumptions on .
and are independent. (to make sure that the factors are uncorrelated)
Any solution of the above set of equations following the constraints for is defined as the factors, and as the loading matrix.
Suppose . Then note that from the conditions just imposed on , we have

or

or

Note that for any orthogonal matrix if we set and , the criteria for being factors and factor loadings still hold. Hence a set of factors and factor loadings is identical only up to orthogonal transformations.
