An example of how SE is used, is to make confidence intervals of the unknown population mean. If the sampling distribution is normally distributed, the sample mean, the standard error, and the quantiles of the normal distribution can be used to calculate confidence intervals for the true population mean. The following expressions can be used to calculate the upper and lower 95% confidence limits, where {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}} {\bar {x}} is equal to the sample mean, {\displaystyle SE} SE is equal to the standard error for the sample mean, and 1.96 is the 0.975 quantile of the normal distribution:

Upper 95% limit {\displaystyle ={\bar {x}}+({\text{SE}}\times 1.96),} ={\bar {x}}+({\text{SE}}\times 1.96), and
Lower 95% limit {\displaystyle ={\bar {x}}-({\text{SE}}\times 1.96).} ={\bar {x}}-({\text{SE}}\times 1.96).
In particular, the standard error of a sample statistic (such as sample mean) is the actual or estimated standard deviation of the error in the process by which it was generated. In other words, it is the actual or estimated standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample statistic. The notation for standard error can be any one of SE, SEM (for standard error of measurement or mean), or SE.

Standard errors provide simple measures of uncertainty in a value and are often used because:

in many cases, if the standard error of several individual quantities is known then the standard error of some function of the quantities can be easily calculated;
when the probability distribution of the value is known, it can be used to calculate an exact confidence interval;
when the probability distribution is unknown, Chebyshev's or the Vysochanski?¨CPetunin inequalities can be used to calculate a conservative confidence interval; and
as the sample size tends to infinity the central limit theorem guarantees that the sampling distribution of the mean is asymptotically normal.
