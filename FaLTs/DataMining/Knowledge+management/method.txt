Knowledge may be accessed at three stages: before, during, or after KM-related activities.[29] Organisations have tried knowledge capture incentives, including making content submission mandatory and incorporating rewards into performance measurement plans.[43] Considerable controversy exists over whether such incentives work and no consensus has emerged.[7]

One strategy to KM involves actively managing knowledge (push strategy).[7][44] In such an instance, individuals strive to explicitly encode their knowledge into a shared knowledge repository, such as a database, as well as retrieving knowledge they need that other individuals have provided (codification).[44]

Another strategy involves individuals making knowledge requests of experts associated with a particular subject on an ad hoc basis (pull strategy).[7][44] In such an instance, expert individual(s) provide insights to requestor (personalisation).[30]

Hansen et al. defined the two strategies.[45] Codification focuses on collecting and storing codified knowledge in electronic databases to make it accessible.[46] Codification can therefore refer to both tacit and explicit knowledge.[47] In contrast, personalization encourages individuals to share their knowledge directly.[46] Information technology plays a less important role, as it is only facilitates communication and knowledge sharing.

Other knowledge management strategies and instruments for companies include:[7][24][30]

Knowledge sharing (fostering a culture that encourages the sharing of information, based on the concept that knowledge is not irrevocable and should be shared and updated to remain relevant)
Storytelling (as a means of transferring tacit knowledge)
Cross-project learning
Make knowledge-sharing as a key roles in employees' job description
After-action reviews
Knowledge mapping (a map of knowledge repositories within a company accessible by all)
Communities of practice
Expert directories (to enable knowledge seeker to reach to the experts)
Expert systems (knowledge seeker responds to one or more specific questions to reach knowledge in a repository)
Best practice transfer
Knowledge fairs
Competence management (systematic evaluation and planning of competences of individual organisation members)
Proximity & architecture (the physical situation of employees can be either conducive or obstructive to knowledge sharing)
Master¨Capprentice relationship, Mentor-mentee relationship, Job-shadowing
Collaborative software technologies (wikis, shared bookmarking, blogs, social software, etc.)
Knowledge repositories (databases, bookmarking engines, etc.)
Measuring and reporting intellectual capital (a way of making explicit knowledge for companies)
Knowledge brokers (some organisational members take on responsibility for a specific "field" and act as first reference on a specific subject)
Inter-project knowledge transfer
Intra-organizational knowledge sharing
Inter-organizational knowledge sharing
