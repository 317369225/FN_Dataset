There are some other instances where "nonlinear model" is used to contrast with a linearly structured model, although the term "linear model" is not usually applied. One example of this is nonlinear dimensionality reduction.
An application of the general linear model appears in the analysis of multiple brain scans in scientific experiments where Y contains data from brain scanners, X contains experimental design variables and confounds. It is usually tested in a univariate way (usually referred to a mass-univariate in this setting) and is often referred to as statistical parametric mapping.[2]
Linear regression is widely used in biological, behavioral and social sciences to describe possible relationships between variables. It ranks as one of the most important tools used in these disciplines.

HMMs can be applied in many fields where the goal is to recover a data sequence that is not immediately observable (but other data that depends on the sequence is). Applications include:
Cryptanalysis Speech recognition Speech synthesis Part-of-speech tagging Machine translation Partial discharge Gene prediction Alignment of bio-sequences Activity recognition Protein folding Metamorphic Virus Detection[12]
Bayesian networks are used for modelling knowledge in computational biology and bioinformatics (gene regulatory networks, protein structure, gene expression analysis,[15] learning epistasis from GWAS data sets [16]) medicine,[17] biomonitoring,[18] document classification, information retrieval,[19] semantic search,[20] image processing, data fusion, decision support systems,[21] engineering, gaming and law.[22][23][24]

Logistic regression is used extensively in numerous disciplines, including the medical and social science fields. For example, the Trauma and Injury Severity Score (TRISS), which is widely used to predict mortality in injured patients, was originally developed by Boyd et al using logistic regression.[4] It is also employed in marketing applications such as prediction of a customer's propensity to purchase a product or cease a subscription, etc.[citation needed] For example, logistic regression might be used to predict whether a patient has a given disease (e.g. diabetes), based on observed characteristics of the patient (age, gender, body mass index, results of various blood tests, etc.). Another example might be to predict whether a voter will vote Democratic or Republican, based on age, income, gender, race, state of residence, votes in previous elections, etc.[citation needed] The technique can also be used in engineering, especially for predicting the probability of failure of a given process, system or product.[5][6] In each of these instances, a logistic regression model would compute the relevant odds for each predictor or interaction term, take the natural logarithm of the odds (compute the logit), conduct a linear regression analysis on the predicted values of the logit, and then take the exponential function of the logit to compute the odds ratio. Conditional random fields, an extension of logistic regression to sequential data, are employed in natural language processing.
