Many problems in AI (in reasoning, planning, learning, perception and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of powerful tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[128]
Bayesian networks[129] are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[130] learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm),[131] planning (using decision networks)[132] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[133] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[133]
A key concept from the science of economics is "utility": a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[134] information value theory.[57] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,[135] dynamic decision networks,[133] game theory and mechanism design.[136]
