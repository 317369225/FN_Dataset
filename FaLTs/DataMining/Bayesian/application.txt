HMMs can be applied in many fields where the goal is to recover a data sequence that is not immediately observable (but other data that depends on the sequence is). Applications include:
Cryptanalysis Speech recognition Speech synthesis Part-of-speech tagging Machine translation Partial discharge Gene prediction Alignment of bio-sequences Activity recognition Protein folding Metamorphic Virus Detection[12]
