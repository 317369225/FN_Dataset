Market basket analysis might tell a retailer that customers often purchase shampoo and conditioner together, so putting both items on promotion at the same time would not create a significant increase in profit, while a promotion involving just one of the items would likely drive sales of the other. Market basket analysis can be used to divide customers into groups. A company could look at what other items people purchase along with eggs, and classify them as baking a cake (if they're buying eggs along with flour and sugar) or making omelets (if they're buying eggs along with bacon and cheese). This identification could then be used to drive other programs.
A concept lattice for objects consisting of the integers from 1 to 10, and attributes composite (c), square (s), even (e), odd (o) and prime (p).
Consider O = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, and A = {composite, even, odd, prime, square}. The smallest concept including the number 3 is the one with objects {3,5,7}, and attributes {odd, prime}, for 3 has both of those attributes and {3,5,7} is the set of objects having that set of attributes. The largest concept involving the attribute of being square is the one with objects {1,4,9} and attributes {square}, for 1, 4 and 9 are all the square numbers and all three of them have that set of attributes. It can readily be seen that both of these example concepts satisfy the formal definitions below
The full set of concepts for these objects and attributes is shown in the illustration. It includes a concept for each of the original attributes: the composite numbers, square numbers, even numbers, odd numbers, and prime numbers. Additionally it includes concepts for the even composite numbers, composite square numbers (that is, all square numbers except 1), even composite squares, odd squares, odd composite squares, even primes, and odd primes.
