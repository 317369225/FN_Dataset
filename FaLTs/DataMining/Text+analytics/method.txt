Many statistical methods have been used for statistical analyses. A very brief list of four of the more popular methods is:
General linear model: A widely used model on which various statistical methods are based (e.g. t test, ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA). Usable for assessing the effect of several predictors on one or more continuous dependent variables. Generalized linear model: An extension of the general linear model for discrete dependent variables. Structural equation modelling: Usable for assessing latent structures from measured manifest variables. Item response theory: Models for (mostly) assessing one latent variable from several binary measured variables (e.g. an exam).
