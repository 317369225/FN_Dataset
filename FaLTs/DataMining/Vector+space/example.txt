A second key example of a vector space is provided by pairs of real numbers x and y. (The order of the components x and y is significant, so such a pair is also called an ordered pair.) Such a pair is written as (x, y). The sum of two such pairs and multiplication of a pair with a number is defined as follows:
(x1, y1) + (x2, y2) = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)
and
a�?x, y) = (ax, ay).
A simple example is the real numbers with the standard multiplication as the inner product
More generally, any Euclidean space n with the dot product is an inner product space where xT is the transpose of x.
The general form of an inner product on n is known as the Hermitian form and is given by
where M is any Hermitian positive-definite matrix, and x* the conjugate transpose of x. For the real case this corresponds to the dot product of the results of directionally differential scaling of the two vectors, with positive scale factors and orthogonal directions of scaling. Up to an orthogonal transformation it is a weighted-sum version of the dot product, with positive weights.
The article on Hilbert space has several examples of inner product spaces wherein the metric induced by the inner product yields a complete metric space. An example of an inner product which induces an incomplete metric occurs with the space C[a, b] of continuous complex valued functions on the interval [a, b]. The inner product is
This space is not complete; consider for example, for the interval [�?,1] the sequence of "step" functions { fk }k where fk(t) is 0 for t in the subinterval [�?,0] fk(t) is 1 for t in the subinterval [1/k, 1] fk is affine in (0, 1/k). That is, fk(t) = kt. This sequence is a Cauchy sequence which does not converge to a continuous function.
For random variables X and Y, the expected value of their product
is an inner product. In this case, <X, X>=0 if and only if Pr(X=0)=1 (i.e., X=0 almost surely). This definition of expectation as inner product can be extended to random vectors as well.
For square real matrices, with transpose as conjugation is an inner product.
Example III: Again take the field to be R, but now let the vector space V be the set RR of all functions from R to R. Let C(R) be the subset consisting of continuous functions. Then C(R) is a subspace of RR.
Proof:
We know from calculus that 0 �?C(R) �?RR. We know from calculus the sum of continuous functions is continuous. Again, we know from calculus that the product of a continuous function and a number is continuous.
Example IV: Keep the same field and vector space as before, but now consider the set Diff(R) of all differentiable functions. The same sort of argument as before shows that this is a subspace too.
Examples that extend these themes are common in functional analysis.
