Information extraction dates back to the late 1970s in the early days of NLP.[1] An early commercial system from the mid 1980s was JASPER built for Reuters by the Carnegie Group with the aim of providing real-time financial news to financial traders.[2]
Beginning in 1987, IE was spurred by a series of Message Understanding Conferences. MUC is a competition-based conference that focused on the following domains:
MUC-1 (1987), MUC-2 (1989): Naval operations messages. MUC-3 (1991), MUC-4 (1992): Terrorism in Latin American countries. MUC-5 (1993): Joint ventures and microelectronics domain. MUC-6 (1995): News articles on management changes. MUC-7 (1998): Satellite launch reports.
Considerable support came from DARPA, the US defense agency, who wished to automate mundane tasks performed by government analysts, such as scanning newspapers for possible links to terrorism.
