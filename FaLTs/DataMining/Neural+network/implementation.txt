In common ANN implementations, the synapse signal is simply a real number, and the output of each neuron is calculated by a non-linear function of the sum of all its input. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream. Further, they may have a threshold such that only if the aggregate signal is below (or above) that level is the downstream signal sent.
