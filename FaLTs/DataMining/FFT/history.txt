The development of fast algorithms for DFT can be traced to Gauss's unpublished work in 1805 when he needed it to interpolate the orbit of asteroids Pallas and Juno from sample observations.[6][7] His method was very similar to the one published in 1965 by Cooley and Tukey, who are generally credited for the invention of the modern generic FFT algorithm. While Gauss's work predated even Fourier's results in 1822, he did not analyze the computation time and eventually used other methods to achieve his goal.

Between 1805 and 1965, some versions of FFT were published by other authors. Yates in 1932 published his version called interaction algorithm, which provided efficient computation of Hadamard and Walsh transforms.[8] Yates' algorithm is still used in the field of statistical design and analysis of experiments. In 1942, Danielson and Lanczos published their version to compute DFT for x-ray crystallography, a field where calculation of Fourier transforms presented a formidable bottleneck.[9][10] While many methods in the past had focused on reducing the constant factor for {\displaystyle O(n^{2})} O(n^{2}) computation by taking advantage of symmetries, Danielson and Lanczos realized that one could use the periodicity and apply a "doubling trick" to get {\displaystyle O(n\log n)} O(n\log n) runtime.[11]

Cooley and Tukey published a more general version of FFT in 1965 that is applicable when N is composite and not necessarily a power of 2.[12] Tukey came up with the idea during a meeting of President Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee where a discussion topic involved detecting nuclear tests by the Soviet Union by setting up sensors to surround the country from outside. To analyze the output of these sensors, a fast Fourier transform algorithm would be needed. In discussion with Tukey, Richard Garwin recognized the general applicability of the algorithm not just to national security problems, but also to a wide range of problems including one of immediate interest to him, determining the periodicities of the spin orientations in a 3-D crystal of Helium-3.[13] Garwin gave Tukey's idea to Cooley (both worked at IBM's Watson labs) for implementation.[14] Cooley and Tukey published the paper in a relatively short six months.[15] As Tukey didn't work at IBM, the patentability of the idea was doubted and the algorithm went into the public domain, which, through the computing revolution of the next decade, made FFT one of the indispensable algorithms in digital signal processing.
