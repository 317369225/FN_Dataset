FFT's importance derives from the fact that in signal processing and image processing it has made working in frequency domain equally computationally feasible as working in temporal or spatial domain. Some of the important applications of FFT includes,[15][45]

Fast large integer and polynomial multiplication
Efficient matrix-vector multiplication for Toeplitz, circulant and other structured matrices
Filtering algorithms
Fast algorithms for discrete cosine or sine transforms (example, Fast DCT used for JPEG, MP3/MPEG encoding)
Fast Chebyshev approximation
Fast discrete Hartley transform
Solving difference equations
Computation of isotopic distributions.[46]
