The probability distribution of the sum of two independent random variables is the convolution of each of their distributions. Probability distributions are not a vector space �?they are not closed under linear combinations, as these do not preserve non-negativity or total integral 1 �?but they are closed under convex combination, thus forming a convex subset of the space of functions (or measures).
