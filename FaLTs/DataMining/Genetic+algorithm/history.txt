Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon who used what John McCarthy calls an "approximation"[2] in 1958 wrote that alpha–beta "appears to have been reinvented a number of times".[3] Arthur Samuel had an early version and Richards, Hart, Levine and/or Edwards found alpha–beta independently in the United States.[4] McCarthy proposed similar ideas during the Dartmouth Conference in 1956 and suggested it to a group of his students including Alan Kotok at MIT in 1961.[5] Alexander Brudno independently discovered the alpha–beta algorithm, publishing his results in 1963.[6] Donald Knuth and Ronald W. Moore refined the algorithm in 1975[7][8] and Judea Pearl proved its optimality in 1982.[9]
Chronology of COA algorithms
Chronology of Ant colony optimization algorithms.
1959, Pierre-Paul Grassé invented the theory of Stigmergy to explain the behavior of nest building in termites;[68] 1983, Deneubourg and his colleagues studied the collective behavior of ants;[69] 1988, and Moyson Manderick have an article on self-organization among ants;[70] 1989, the work of Goss, Aron, Deneubourg and Pasteels on the collective behavior of Argentine ants, which will give the idea of Ant colony optimization algorithms;[3] 1989, implementation of a model of behavior for food by Ebling and his colleagues;[71] 1991, M. Dorigo proposed the Ant System in his doctoral thesis (which was published in 1992[2]). A technical report extracted from the thesis and co-authored by V. Maniezzo and A. Colorni [72] was published five years later;[10] 1996, publication of the article on Ant System;[10] 1996, Hoos and Stützle invent the MAX-MIN Ant System;[5] 1997, Dorigo and Gambardella publish the Ant Colony System;[6] 1997, Schoonderwoerd and his colleagues developed the first application to telecommunication networks;[73] 1998, Dorigo launches first conference dedicated to the ACO algorithms;[74] 1998, Stützle proposes initial parallel implementations;[75] 1999, Bonabeau, Dorigo and Theraulaz publish a book dealing mainly with artificial ants [76] 2000, special issue of the Future Generation Computer Systems journal on ant algorithms[77] 2000, first applications to the scheduling, scheduling sequence and the satisfaction of constraints; 2000, Gutjahr provides the first evidence of convergence for an algorithm of ant colonies[78] 2001, the first use of COA Algorithms by companies (Eurobios and AntOptima); 2001, IREDA and his colleagues published the first multi-objective algorithm [79] 2002, first applications in the design of schedule, Bayesian networks; 2002, Bianchi and her colleagues suggested the first algorithm for stochastic problem;[80] 2004, Zlochin and Dorigo show that some algorithms are equivalent to the stochastic gradient descent, the cross-entropy and algorithms to estimate distribution [9] 2005, first applications to protein folding problems. 2012, Prabhakar and colleagues publish research relating to the operation of individual ants communicating in tandem without pheromones, mirroring the principles of computer network organization. The communication model has been compared to the Transmission Control Protocol. [81]
