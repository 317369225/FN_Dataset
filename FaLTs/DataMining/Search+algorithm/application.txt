The Bees Algorithm has found many applications in engineering, such as:
Training neural networks for pattern recognition.[9][10][11][12][13] Forming manufacturing cells.[2] Scheduling jobs for a production machine.[3] Solving continuous problems and engineering optimization.[14] Finding multiple feasible solutions to a preliminary design problems.[15] Data clustering[16] Optimising the design of mechanical components.[17] Multi-Objective Optimisation.[18] Tuning a fuzzy logic controller for a robot gymnast.[19] Computer Vision and Image Analysis.[20][21][22]
This approach is used for a number of NP-hard problems, such as
Knapsack problem Integer programming Nonlinear programming Traveling salesman problem (TSP) Quadratic assignment problem (QAP) Maximum satisfiability problem (MAX-SAT) Nearest neighbor search (NNS) Cutting stock problem False noise analysis (FNA) Computational phylogenetics
Branch-and-bound may also be a base of various heuristics. For example, one may wish to stop branching when the gap between the upper and lower bounds becomes smaller than a certain threshold. This is used when the solution is "good enough for practical purposes" and can greatly reduce the computations required. This type of solution is particularly applicable when the cost function used is noisy or is the result of statistical estimates and so is not known precisely but rather only known to lie within a range of values with a specific probability. An example of its application here is in biology when performing cladistic analysis to evaluate evolutionary relationships between organisms, where the data sets are often impractically large without heuristics[citation needed].
For this reason, branch-and-bound techniques are often used in game tree search algorithms, most notably through the use of alpha-beta pruning.
Breadth-first search can be used to solve many problems in graph theory, for example:
Finding all nodes within one connected component Copying Collection, Cheney's algorithm Finding the shortest path between two nodes u and v (with path length measured by number of edges) Testing a graph for bipartiteness (Reverse) Cuthill–McKee mesh numbering Ford–Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network Serialization/Deserialization of a binary tree vs serialization in sorted order, allows the tree to be re-constructed in an efficient manner.

Algorithms that use depth-first search as a building block include:
Finding connected components. Topological sorting. Finding 2-(edge or vertex)-connected components. Finding 3-(edge or vertex)-connected components. Finding the bridges of a graph. Finding strongly connected components. Planarity testing[4][5] Solving puzzles with only one solution, such as mazes. (DFS can be adapted to find all solutions to a maze by only including nodes on the current path in the visited set.) Maze generation may use a randomized depth-first search. Finding biconnectivity in graphs.
