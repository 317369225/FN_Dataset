A parameter (from the Ancient Greek ¦Ð¦Á¦Ñ?, para: "beside", "subsidiary"; and ¦Ì?¦Ó¦Ñ¦Ï¦Í, metron: "measure"), generally, is any characteristic that can help in defining or classifying a particular system (meaning an event, project, object, situation, etc.). That is, a parameter is an element of a system that is useful, or critical, when identifying the system, or when evaluating its performance, status, condition, etc.
