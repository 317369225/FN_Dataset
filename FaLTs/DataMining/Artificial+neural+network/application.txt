The tasks artificial neural networks are applied to tend to fall within the following broad categories:
Function approximation, or regression analysis, including time series prediction, fitness approximation and modeling. Classification, including pattern and sequence recognition, novelty detection and sequential decision making. Data processing, including filtering, clustering, blind source separation and compression. Robotics, including directing manipulators, Computer numerical control.
Application areas include system identification and control (vehicle control, process control, natural resources management), quantum chemistry,[7] game-playing and decision making (backgammon, chess, poker), pattern recognition (radar systems, face identification, object recognition and more), sequence recognition (gesture, speech, handwritten text recognition), medical diagnosis, financial applications (automated trading systems), data mining (or knowledge discovery in databases, "KDD"), visualization and e-mail spam filtering.
Artificial neural networks have also been used to diagnose several cancers. An ANN based hybrid lung cancer detection system named HLND improves the accuracy of diagnosis and the speed of lung cancer radiology.[8] These networks have also been used to diagnose prostate cancer. The diagnoses can be used to make specific models taken from a large group of patients compared to information of one given patient. The models do not depend on assumptions about correlations of different variables. Colorectal cancer has also been predicted using the neural networks. Neural networks could predict the outcome for a patient with colorectal cancer with a lot more accuracy than the current clinical methods. After training, the networks could predict multiple patient outcomes from unrelated institutions.[9]

In 2006, the on-line movie company Netflix held the first "Netflix Prize" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and beat its existing Netflix movie recommendation system by at least 10%. The AT&T Research Team BellKor beat out several other teams with their machine learning program "Pragmatic Chaos". After winning several minor prizes, it won the grand prize competition in 2009 for $1 million.[9]
Multilayer perceptrons using a backpropagation algorithm are the standard algorithm for any supervised learning pattern recognition process and the subject of ongoing research in computational neuroscience and parallel distributed processing. They are useful in research in terms of their ability to solve problems stochastically, which often allows one to get approximate solutions for extremely complex problems like fitness approximation.
MLPs were a popular machine learning solution in the 1980s, finding applications in diverse fields such as speech recognition, image recognition, and machine translation software,[5] but have since the 1990s faced strong competition from the much simpler (and related[6]) support vector machines. More recently, there has been some renewed interest in backpropagation networks due to the successes of deep learning.

To select interesting rules from the set of all possible rules, constraints on various measures of significance and interest can be used. The best-known constraints are minimum thresholds on support and confidence.
The support of an itemset is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contain the itemset. In the example database, the itemset has a support of since it occurs in 20% of all transactions (1 out of 5 transactions).
The confidence of a rule is defined . For example, the rule has a confidence of in the database, which means that for 50% of the transactions containing milk and bread the rule is correct (50% of the times a customer buys milk and bread, butter is bought as well). Be careful when reading the expression: here supp(XâˆªY) means "support for occurrences of transactions where X and Y both appear", not "support for occurrences of transactions where either X or Y appears", the latter interpretation arising because set union is equivalent to logical disjunction. The argument of is a set of preconditions, and thus becomes more restrictive as it grows (instead of more inclusive).
Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability , the probability of finding the RHS of the rule in transactions under the condition that these transactions also contain the LHS.[3]
The lift of a rule is defined as or the ratio of the observed support to that expected if X and Y were independent. The rule has a lift of .
The conviction of a rule is defined as . The rule has a conviction of , and can be interpreted as the ratio of the expected frequency that X occurs without Y (that is to say, the frequency that the rule makes an incorrect prediction) if X and Y were independent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions. In this example, the conviction value of 1.2 shows that the rule would be incorrect 20% more often (1.2 times as often) if the association between X and Y was purely random chance.
Biology, computational biology and bioinformatics
Plant and animal ecology cluster analysis is used to describe and to make spatial and temporal comparisons of communities (assemblages) of organisms in heterogeneous environments; it is also used in plant systematics to generate artificial phylogenies or clusters of organisms (individuals) at the species, genus or higher level that share a number of attributes Transcriptomics clustering is used to build groups of genes with related expression patterns (also known as coexpressed genes). Often such groups contain functionally related proteins, such as enzymes for a specific pathway, or genes that are co-regulated. High throughput experiments using expressed sequence tags (ESTs) or DNA microarrays can be a powerful tool for genome annotation, a general aspect of genomics. Sequence analysis clustering is used to group homologous sequences into gene families. This is a very important concept in bioinformatics, and evolutionary biology in general. See evolution by gene duplication. High-throughput genotyping platforms clustering algorithms are used to automatically assign genotypes. Human genetic clustering The similarity of genetic data is used in clustering to infer population structures.
Medicine
Medical imaging On PET scans, cluster analysis can be used to differentiate between different types of tissue and blood in a three dimensional image. In this application, actual position does not matter, but the voxel intensity is considered as a vector, with a dimension for each image that was taken over time. This technique allows, for example, accurate measurement of the rate a radioactive tracer is delivered to the area of interest, without a separate sampling of arterial blood, an intrusive technique that is most common today. IMRT segmentation Clustering can be used to divide a fluence map into distinct regions for conversion into deliverable fields in MLC-based Radiation Therapy.
Business and marketing
Market research Cluster analysis is widely used in market research when working with multivariate data from surveys and test panels. Market researchers use cluster analysis to partition the general population of consumers into market segments and to better understand the relationships between different groups of consumers/potential customers, and for use in market segmentation, Product positioning, New product development and Selecting test markets. Grouping of shopping items Clustering can be used to group all the shopping items available on the web into a set of unique products. For example, all the items on eBay can be grouped into unique products. (eBay doesn't have the concept of a SKU)
World wide web
Social network analysis In the study of social networks, clustering may be used to recognize communities within large groups of people. Search result grouping In the process of intelligent grouping of the files and websites, clustering may be used to create a more relevant set of search results compared to normal search engines like Google. There are currently a number of web based clustering tools such as Clusty. Slippy map optimization Flickr's map of photos and other map sites use clustering to reduce the number of markers on a map. This makes it both faster and reduces the amount of visual clutter.
Computer science
Software evolution Clustering is useful in software evolution as it helps to reduce legacy properties in code by reforming functionality that has become dispersed. It is a form of restructuring and hence is a way of directly preventative maintenance. Image segmentation Clustering can be used to divide a digital image into distinct regions for border detection or object recognition. Evolutionary algorithms Clustering may be used to identify different niches within the population of an evolutionary algorithm so that reproductive opportunity can be distributed more evenly amongst the evolving species or subspecies. Recommender systems Recommender systems are designed to recommend new items based on a user's tastes. They sometimes use clustering algorithms to predict a user's preferences based on the preferences of other users in the user's cluster. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods Clustering is often utilized to locate and characterize extrema in the target distribution.
Social science
Crime analysis Cluster analysis can be used to identify areas where there are greater incidences of particular types of crime. By identifying these distinct areas or "hot spots" where a similar crime has happened over a period of time, it is possible to manage law enforcement resources more effectively. Educational data mining Cluster analysis is for example used to identify groups of schools or students with similar properties.
Others
Field robotics Clustering algorithms are used for robotic situational awareness to track objects and detect outliers in sensor data.[32] Mathematical chemistry To find structural similarity, etc., for example, 3000 chemical compounds were clustered in the space of 90 topological indices.[33] Climatology To find weather regimes or preferred sea level pressure atmospheric patterns.[34] Petroleum geology Cluster analysis is used to reconstruct missing bottom hole core data or missing log curves in order to evaluate reservoir properties. Physical geography The clustering of chemical properties in different sample locations.
In data analysis, GTMs are like a nonlinear version of principal components analysis, which allows high dimensional data to be modelled as resulting from Gaussian noise added to sources in lower-dimensional latent space. For example, to locate stocks in plottable 2D space based on their hi-D time-series shapes. Other applications may want to have fewer sources than data points, for example mixture models.
In generative deformational modelling, the latent and data spaces have the same dimensions, for example, 2D images or 1 audio sound waves. Extra 'empty' dimensions are added to the source (known as the 'template' in this form of modelling), for example locating the 1D sound wave in 2D space. Further nonlinear dimensions are then added, produced by combining the original dimensions. The enlarged latent space is then projected back into the 1D data space. The probability of a given projection is, as before, given by the product of the likelihood of the data under the Gaussian noise model with the prior on the deformation parameter. Unlike conventional spring-based deformation modelling, this has the advantage of being analytically optimizable. The disadvantage is that it is a 'data-mining' approach, i.e. the shape of the deformation prior is unlikely to be meaningful as an explanation of the possible deformations, as it is based on a very high, artificial- and arbitrarily constructed nonlinear latent space. For this reason the prior is learned from data rather than created by a human expert, as is possible for spring-based models.
The following commercial applications have been developed using NuPIC:
Vitamin D Video - a video surveillance application that uses HTM to detect people in video by differentiating them from other moving objects. EDSA power analytics system [14] - an electrical power analytics, supervision and diagnostic system scheduled to be deployed in an oil field in the North Sea. It uses HTM to learn and distinguish between â€œroutineï¿½?and â€œnon-routineï¿½?events in an electrical power network. The system alerts an operator when a situation is not normal. Lockheed Martin has been using and modifying HTM technology for several applications such as integrating multiple types of sensory inputs and object recognition from geospatial imagery of an urban environment.[15] iResemble [16] - an iPhone application implemented using the Vision Toolkit. It has a trained HTM network that classifies a submitted photo and outputs a belief of what type of person the photo resembles.


Consider a dataset represented as a matrix (or a database table), such that each row represents a set of attributes (or features or dimensions) that describe a particular instance of something. If the number of attributes is large, then the space of unique possible rows is exponentially large. Thus, the larger the dimensionality, the more difficult it becomes to sample the space. This causes many problems. Algorithms that operate on high-dimensional data tend to have a very high time complexity. Many machine learning algorithms, for example, struggle with high-dimensional data. This has become known as the curse of dimensionality. Reducing data into fewer dimensions often makes analysis algorithms more efficient, and can help machine learning algorithms make more accurate predictions.
Humans often have difficulty comprehending data in many dimensions. Thus, reducing data to a small number of dimensions is useful for visualization purposes.
The reduced-dimensional representations of data are often referred to as "intrinsic variables". This description implies that these are the values from which the data was produced. For example, consider a dataset that contains images of a letter 'A', which has been scaled and rotated by varying amounts. Each image has 32x32 pixels. Each image can be represented as a vector of 1024 pixel values. Each row is a sample on a two-dimensional manifold in 1024-dimensional space (a Hamming space). The intrinsic dimensionality is two, because two variables (rotation and scale) were varied in order to produce the data. Information about the shape or look of a letter 'A' is not part of the intrinsic variables because it is the same in every instance. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction will discard the correlated information (the letter 'A') and recover only the varying information (rotation and scale). The image to the left shows sample images from this dataset (to save space, not all input images are shown), and a plot of the two-dimensional points that results from using a NLDR algorithm (in this case, Manifold Sculpting was used) to reduce the data into just two dimensions.
By comparison, if PCA (a linear dimensionality reduction algorithm) is used to reduce this same dataset into two dimensions, the resulting values are not so well organized. This demonstrates that the high-dimensional vectors (each representing a letter 'A') that sample this manifold vary in a non-linear manner.
It should be apparent, therefore, that NLDR has several applications in the field of computer-vision. For example, consider a robot that uses a camera to navigate in a closed static environment. The images obtained by that camera can be considered to be samples on a manifold in high-dimensional space, and the intrinsic variables of that manifold will represent the robot's position and orientation. This utility is not limited to robots. Dynamical systems, a more general class of systems, which includes robots, are defined in terms of a manifold. Active research in NLDR seeks to unfold the observation manifolds associated dynamical systems to develop techniques for modeling such systems and enable them to operate autonomously.[2]
Random multinomial logit models combine a random ensemble of multinomial logit models for use as a classifier.
In order to make any use of unlabeled data, we must assume some structure to the underlying distribution of data. Semi-supervised learning algorithms make use of at least one of the following assumptions. [1]
