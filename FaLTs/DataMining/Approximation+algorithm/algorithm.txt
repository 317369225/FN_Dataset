By now there are several established techniques to design approximation algorithms. These include the following ones.

Greedy algorithm
Local search
Enumeration and dynamic programming
Solving a convex programming relaxation to get a fractional solution. Then converting this fractional solution into a feasible solution by some appropriate rounding. The popular relaxations include the following.
Linear programming relaxations
Semidefinite programming relaxations
Primal-Dual Methods
Dual Fitting
Embedding the problem in some metric and then solving the problem on the metric. This is also known as metric embedding.
Random sampling and the use of randomness in general in conjunction with the methods above.
