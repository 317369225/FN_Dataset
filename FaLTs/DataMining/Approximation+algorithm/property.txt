In the literature, an approximation ratio for a maximization (minimization) problem of c - ? (min: c + ?) means that the algorithm has an approximation ratio of c ? ? for arbitrary ? > 0 but that the ratio has not (or cannot) be shown for ? = 0. An example of this is the optimal inapproximability ！ inexistence of approximation ！ ratio of 7 / 8 + ? for satisfiable MAX-3SAT instances due to Johan H?stad.[13] As mentioned previously, when c = 1, the problem is said to have a polynomial-time approximation scheme.

An ?-term may appear when an approximation algorithm introduces a multiplicative error and a constant error while the minimum optimum of instances of size n goes to infinity as n does. In this case, the approximation ratio is c ? k / OPT = c ? o(1) for some constants c and k. Given arbitrary ? > 0, one can choose a large enough N such that the term k / OPT < ? for every n − N. For every fixed ?, instances of size n < N can be solved by brute force , thereby showing an approximation ratio ！ existence of approximation algorithms with a guarantee ！ of c ? ? for every ? > 0.
