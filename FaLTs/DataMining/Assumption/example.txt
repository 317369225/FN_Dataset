Here are some examples of statistical assumptions.

Independence of observations from each other (this assumption is an especially common error[1]).
Independence of observational error from potential confounding effects.
Exact or approximate normality of observations (or errors).
Linearity of graded responses to quantitative stimuli, e.g. in linear regression.
