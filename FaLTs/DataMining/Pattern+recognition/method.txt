The traditional grammatical exercise of parsing, sometimes known as clause analysis, involves breaking down a text into its component parts of speech with an explanation of the form, function, and syntactic relationship of each part.[3] To parse a phrase such as 'man bites dog' involves noting that the singular noun 'man' is the subject of the sentence, the verb 'bites' is the third person singular of the present tense of the verb 'to bite', and the singular noun 'dog' is the object of the sentence. Techniques such as sentence diagrams are sometimes used to indicate the relation between elements in the sentence.
Parsing was formerly central to the teaching of grammar throughout the English-speaking world, and widely regarded as basic to the use and understanding of written language. However the teaching of such techniques is no longer current.
Although the parameters of a regression model are usually estimated using the method of least squares, other methods which have been used include:
Bayesian methods, e.g. Bayesian linear regression Percentage regression, for situations where reducing percentage errors is deemed more appropriate.[21] Least absolute deviations, which is more robust in the presence of outliers, leading to quantile regression Nonparametric regression, requires a large number of observations and is computationally intensive Distance metric learning, which is learned by the search of a meaningful distance metric in a given input space.[22]
