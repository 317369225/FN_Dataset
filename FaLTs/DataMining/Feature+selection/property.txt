Many standard data analysis software systems are often used for feature selection, such as SciLab, NumPy and the R language. Other software systems are tailored specifically to the feature-selection task:
Weka �?freely available and open-source software in Java. Feature Selection Toolbox 3 �?freely available and open-source software in C++. RapidMiner �?freely available and open-source software. Orange �?freely available and open-source software (module orngFSS). TOOLDIAG Pattern recognition toolbox �?freely available C toolbox. minimum redundancy feature selection tool �?freely available C/Matlab codes for selecting minimum redundant features. A C# Implementation of greedy forward feature subset selection for various classifiers (e.g., LibLinear, SVM-light). MCFS-ID (Monte Carlo Feature Selection and Interdependency Discovery) is a Monte Carlo method-based tool for feature selection. It also allows for the discovery of interdependencies between the relevant features. MCFS-ID is particularly suitable for the analysis of high-dimensional, ill-defined transactional and biological data. RRF is an R package for feature selection and can be installed from R. RRF stands for Regularized Random Forest, which is a type of Regularized Trees. By building a regularized random forest, a compact set of non-redundant features can be selected without loss of predictive information. Regularized trees can capture non-linear interactions between variables, and naturally handle different scales, and numerical and categorical variables.
