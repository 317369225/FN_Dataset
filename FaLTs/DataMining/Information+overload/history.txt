Early history[edit]
Information overload has been documented throughout periods where advances in technology have increased a production of information.[11] As early as the 3rd or 4th century BC, people regarded information overload with disapproval.[11] Around this time, in Ecclesiastes 12:12, the passage revealed the writer's comment "of making books there is no end" and in 1st century AD, Seneca the Elder commented, that "the abundance of books is distraction".[11] Similar complaints around the growth of books were also mentioned in China.[12]

Renaissance[edit]
Around 1440 AD, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press and this marked another period of information proliferation. As a result of lowering production costs, generation of printed materials ranging from pamphlets, manuscripts to books were made available to the average person.[11][13] Scholars complained about the abundance of information for a variety of reasons, such as the diminishing quality of text as printers rushed to print manuscripts and the supply of new information being distracting and difficult to manage.[11]

18th century[edit]
Many grew concerned with the rise of books in Europe, especially in England, France, and Germany. From 1750 to 1800, there was a 150% increase in the production of books.[14] In 1702, jurist and philosopher Christian Thomasius expressed concerns about the overproduction of books, comparing it to an epidemic. Thomasius felt with more books being published, the standards of publishing a book decreased. In 1795, German bookseller and publisher Johann Georg Heinzmann said "no nation printed as much as the Germans"[15] and expresses concern about Germans reading ideas and no longer creating original thoughts and ideas.[14]

Information age[edit]
In the second half of the 20th Century, advances in computer and information technology led to the creation of the Internet.

In the modern information age, information overload is experienced as distracting and unmanageable information such as email spam, email notifications, instant messages, Tweets and Facebook updates in the context of the work environment.[16] Social media has resulted in "social information overload," which can occur on sites like Facebook,[17] and technology is changing to serve our social culture.

In today's society, day-to-day activities increasingly involve the technological world where information technology exacerbates the number of interruptions that occur in the work environment.[18] A 2012 survey by McKinsey Global Institute found that the average worker spends 28% of work time managing email.[19] Adding this decade's use of the Internet, management may be even more disrupted in their decision making, and may result in more poor decisions. Thus, the PIECES framework mentions information overload as a potential problem in existing information systems.[20]

As the world moves into a new era of globalization, an increasing number of people are connecting to the Internet to conduct their own research[21] and are given the ability to produce as well as consume the data accessed on an increasing number of websites. Users are now classified as active users because more people in society are participating in the Digital and Information Age.[22] More and more people are considered to be active writers and viewers because of their participation.[23] This flow has created a new life where we are now in danger of becoming dependent on this method of access to information. Therefore, we see an information overload from the access to so much information, almost instantaneously, without knowing the validity of the content and the risk of misinformation.[24][25]

According to Sonora Jha of Seattle University, journalists use the Web to conduct research, get information regarding interviewing sources and press releases and update news online.[26] Lawrence Lessig has described this as the "read-write" nature of the Internet.[27]

¡°The resulting abundance of ¨C and desire for more (and/or higher quality) ¨C information has come to be perceived in some circles, paradoxically, as the source of as much productivity loss as gain."[28] Information Overload can lead to "information anxiety," which is the gap between the information we understand and the information that we think that we must understand. As people consume increasing amounts of information in the form of news stories, e-mails, blog posts, Facebook statuses, Tweets, Tumblr posts and other new sources of information, they become their own editors, gatekeepers, and aggregators of information.[29] One concern in this field is that massive amounts of information can be distracting and negatively impact productivity and decision-making. Another concern is the "contamination" of useful information with information that might not be entirely accurate (Information pollution). Research done is often done with the view that IO is a problem that can be understood in a rational way.[28]
