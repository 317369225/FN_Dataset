The forward and backward recursions used in HMM as well as computations of marginal smoothing probabilities were first described by Ruslan L. Stratonovich in 1960[6] (pages 160ï¿½?62) and in the late 1950s in his papers in Russian. The Hidden Markov Models were later described in a series of statistical papers by Leonard E. Baum and other authors in the second half of the 1960s. One of the first applications of HMMs was speech recognition, starting in the mid-1970s.[13][14][15][16]
In the second half of the 1980s, HMMs began to be applied to the analysis of biological sequences,[17] in particular DNA. Since then, they have become ubiquitous in the field of bioinformatics.[18]
Andrey Markov produced the first results (1906) for these processes, purely theoretically. A generalization to countably infinite state spaces was given by Kolmogorov (1936). Markov chains are related to Brownian motion and the ergodic hypothesis, two topics in physics which were important in the early years of the twentieth century, but Markov appears to have pursued this out of a mathematical motivation, namely the extension of the law of large numbers to dependent events. In 1913, he applied his findings for the first time to the first 20,000 letters of Pushkin's Eugene Onegin.[citation needed]. By 1917, more practical application of his work was made by Erlang to obtain formulas for call loss and waiting time in telephone network.[14]
Seneta provides an account of Markov's motivations and the theory's early development.[33] The term "chain" was used by Markov (1906).[34]
