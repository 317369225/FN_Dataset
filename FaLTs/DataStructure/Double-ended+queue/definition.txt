In computer science, a double-ended queue (dequeue, often abbreviated to deque) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail).[1] It is also often called a head-tail linked list, though properly this refers to a specific data structure implementation of a deque (see below).
