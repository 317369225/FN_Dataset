This differs from the queue abstract data type or First-In-First-Out List (FIFO), where elements can only be added to one end and removed from the other. This general data class has some possible sub-types:
An input-restricted deque is one where deletion can be made from both ends, but insertion can be made at one end only.
An output-restricted deque is one where insertion can be made at both ends, but deletion can be made from one end only.
Both the basic and most common list types in computing, queues and stacks can be considered specializations of deques, and can be implemented using deques.
