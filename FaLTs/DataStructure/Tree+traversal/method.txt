Morris in-order traversal using threading[edit]
Main article: Threaded binary tree
A binary tree is threaded by making every left child pointer (that would otherwise be null) point to the in-order predecessor of the node (if it exists) and every right child pointer (that would otherwise be null) point to the in-order successor of the node (if it exists).

Advantages:

Avoids recursion, which uses a call stack and consumes memory and time.
The node keeps a record of its parent.
Disadvantages:

The tree is more complex.
We can make only one traversal at a time.
It is more prone to errors when both the children are not present and both values of nodes point to their ancestors.
Morris traversal is an implementation of in-order traversal that uses threading:[6]
