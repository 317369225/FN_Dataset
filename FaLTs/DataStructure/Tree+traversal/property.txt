A binary tree is threaded by making every left child pointer (that would otherwise be null) point to the in-order predecessor of the node (if it exists) and every right child pointer (that would otherwise be null) point to the in-order successor of the node (if it exists).

Advantages:

    Avoids recursion, which uses a call stack and consumes memory and time.
    The node keeps a record of its parent.

Disadvantages:

    The tree is more complex.
    We can make only one traversal at a time.
    It is more prone to errors when both the children are not present and both values of nodes point to their ancestors.
