For a binary tree, they are defined as display operations recursively at each node, starting with the root, 
To traverse any tree with depth-first search, perform the following operations recursively at each node:

    Perform pre-order operation.
    For each i from 1 to the number of children do:
        Visit i-th, if present.
        Perform in-order operation.
    Perform post-order operation.

Depending on the problem at hand, the pre-order, in-order or post-order operations may be void, or you may only want to visit a specific child, so these operations are optional. Also, in practice more than one of pre-order, in-order and post-order operations may be required. For example, when inserting into a ternary tree, a pre-order operation is performed by comparing items. A post-order operation may be needed afterwards to re-balance the tree.
