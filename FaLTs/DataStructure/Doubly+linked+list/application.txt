Language translators like compilers and interpreters use self-organizing lists to maintain symbol tables during compilation or interpretation of program source code. Currently research is underway to incorporate the self-organizing list data structure in embedded systems to reduce bus transition activity which leads to power dissipation in those circuits. These lists are also used in artificial intelligence and neural networks as well as self-adjusting programs. The algorithms used in self-organizing lists are also used as caching algorithms as in the case of LFU algorithm.
