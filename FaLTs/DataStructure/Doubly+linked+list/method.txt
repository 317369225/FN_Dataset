This technique involves swapping an accessed node with its predecessor. Therefore, if any node is accessed, it is swapped with the node in front unless it is the head node, thereby increasing its priority. This algorithm is again easy to implement and space efficient and is more likely to keep frequently accessed nodes at the front of the list. However, the transpose method is more cautious. i.e. it will take many accesses to move the element to the head of the list. This method also does not allow for rapid response to changes in the query distributions on the nodes in the list.
If the 5th node in the list is selected, it will be swapped with the 4th
At the t-th item selection:
         if item i is selected:
             if i is not the head of list:
                     swap item i with item (i - 1)
