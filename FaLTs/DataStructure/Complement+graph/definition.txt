As stated above, in different contexts it may be useful to define the term graph with different degrees of generality. Whenever it is necessary to draw a strict distinction, the following terms are used. Most commonly, in modern texts in graph theory, unless stated otherwise, graph means "undirected simple finite graph" (see the definitions below).
A biconnected undirected graph is a connected graph that is not broken into disconnected pieces by deleting any single vertex (and its incident edges).
A biconnected directed graph is one such that for any two vertices v and w there are two directed paths from v to w which have no vertices in common other than v and w.

Suppose that is a group and is a generating set. The Cayley graph is a colored directed graph constructed as follows[2]
Each element of is assigned a vertex: the vertex set of is identified with Each generator of is assigned a color . For any the vertices corresponding to the elements and are joined by a directed edge of colour Thus the edge set consists of pairs of the form with providing the color.
In geometric group theory, the set is usually assumed to be finite, symmetric (i.e. ) and not containing the identity element of the group. In this case, the uncolored Cayley graph is an ordinary graph: its edges are not oriented and it does not contain loops (single-element cycles) if and only if .
A clique in an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a subset of the vertex set C �?#160;V, such that for every two vertices in C, there exists an edge connecting the two. This is equivalent to saying that the subgraph induced by C is complete (in some cases, the term clique may also refer to the subgraph).
A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by including one more adjacent vertex, that is, a clique which does not exist exclusively within the vertex set of a larger clique.
A maximum clique is a clique of the largest possible size in a given graph. The clique number ω(G) of a graph G is the number of vertices in a maximum clique in G. The intersection number of G is the smallest number of cliques that together cover all edges of G.
The opposite of a clique is an independent set, in the sense that every clique corresponds to an independent set in the complement graph. The clique cover problem concerns finding as few cliques as possible that include every vertex in the graph. A related concept is a biclique, a complete bipartite subgraph. The bipartite dimension of a graph is the minimum number of bicliques needed to cover all the edges of the graph.
Any cograph may be constructed using the following rules:
any single vertex graph is a cograph; if is a cograph, so is its complement ; if and are cographs, so is their disjoint union .
Several alternative characterizations of cographs can be given. Among them:
A cograph is a graph which does not contain the path P4 on 4 vertices (and hence of length 3) as an induced subgraph. That is, a graph is a cograph if and only if for any four vertices , if and are edges of the graph then at least one of or is also an edge (Corneil, Lerchs & Burlingham 1981). A cograph is a graph all of whose induced subgraphs have the property that any maximal clique intersects any maximal independent set in a single vertex. A cograph is a graph in which every nontrivial induced subgraph has at least two vertices with the same neighbourhoods. A cograph is a graph in which every connected induced subgraph has a disconnected complement. A cograph is a graph all of whose connected induced subgraphs have diameter at most 2. A cograph is a graph in which every connected component is a distance-hereditary graph with diameter at most 2. A cograph is a graph with clique-width at most 2 (Courcelle & Olariu 2000).
All complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, threshold graphs, and Turán graphs are cographs. Every cograph is distance-hereditary, a comparability graph, and perfect.
Cographs are the comparability graphs of series-parallel partial orders (Jung 1978).
A complete bipartite graph, G := (V1 + V2, E), is a bipartite graph such that for any two vertices, v1 �?V1 and v2 �?V2, v1v2 is an edge in G. The complete bipartite graph with partitions of size |V1|=m and |V2|=n, is denoted Km,n.
In an undirected graph G, two vertices u and v are called connected if G contains a path from u to v. Otherwise, they are called disconnected. If the two vertices are additionally connected by a path of length 1, i.e. by a single edge, the vertices are called adjacent. A graph is said to be connected if every pair of vertices in the graph is connected.
A connected component is a maximal connected subgraph of G. Each vertex belongs to exactly one connected component, as does each edge.
A directed graph is called weakly connected if replacing all of its directed edges with undirected edges produces a connected (undirected) graph. It is connected if it contains a directed path from u to v or a directed path from v to u for every pair of vertices u, v. It is strongly connected or strong if it contains a directed path from u to v and a directed path from v to u for every pair of vertices u, v. The strong components are the maximal strongly connected subgraphs.
A cut, vertex cut, or separating set of a connected graph G is a set of vertices whose removal renders G disconnected. The connectivity or vertex connectivity κ(G) (where G is not a complete graph) is the size of a minimal vertex cut. A graph is called k-connected or k-vertex-connected if its vertex connectivity is k or greater. This means a graph G is said to be k-connected if there does not exist a set of k-1 vertices whose removal disconnects the graph. A complete graph with n vertices, denoted , has no vertex cuts at all, but by convention κ() = n-1. A vertex cut for two vertices u and v is a set of vertices whose removal from the graph disconnects u and v. The local connectivity κ(u, v) is the size of a smallest vertex cut separating u and v. Local connectivity is symmetric for undirected graphs; that is, κ(u,v)=κ(v,u). Moreover, except for complete graphs, κ(G) equals the minimum of κ(u,v) over all nonadjacent pairs of vertices u, v.
2-connectivity is also called biconnectivity and 3-connectivity is also called triconnectivity.
Analogous concepts can be defined for edges. In the simple case in which cutting a single, specific edge would disconnect the graph, that edge is called a bridge. More generally, the edge cut of G is a group of edges whose total removal renders the graph disconnected. The edge-connectivity λ(G) is the size of a smallest edge cut, and the local edge-connectivity λ(u,v) of two vertices u, v is the size of a smallest edge cut disconnecting u from v. Again, local edge-connectivity is symmetric. A graph is called k-edge-connected if its edge connectivity is k or greater.
Let G = (E,V) be an arbitrary graph. If G' = (E \ X,V) is connected for all X �?#160;E where |X| < k, then G is k-edge-connected. Trivially, a graph that is k-edge-connected is also (k�?)-edge-connected.
Given a graph G, its line graph L(G) is a graph such that
each vertex of L(G) represents an edge of G; and two vertices of L(G) are adjacent if and only if their corresponding edges share a common endpoint ("are adjacent") in G.
That is, it is the intersection graph of the edges of G, representing each edge by the set of its two endpoints.
In any graph, for any two vertices a and b, define the interval of vertices that lie on shortest paths
I(a,b) = {v | d(a,b) = d(a,v) + d(v,b)}. 
A median graph is defined by the property that, for any three vertices a, b, and c, these intervals intersect in a single point:
For all a, b, and c, |I(a,b) �?I(a,c) �?I(b,c)| = 1.
Equivalently, for every three vertices a, b, and c one can find a vertex m(a,b,c) such that the unweighted distances in the graph satisfy the equalities
d(a,b) = d(a,m(a,b,c)) + d(m(a,b,c),b) d(a,c) = d(a,m(a,b,c)) + d(m(a,b,c),c) d(b,c) = d(b,m(a,b,c)) + d(m(a,b,c),c)
and m(a,b,c) is the only vertex for which this is true.
It is also possible to define median graphs as the solution sets of 2-satisfiability problems, as the retracts of hypercubes, as the graphs of finite median algebras, as the Buneman graphs of Helly split systems, and as the graphs of windex 2; see the sections below.
Every planar graph without loops is 4-partite, or 4-colorable; this is the graph-theoretical formulation of the four color theorem.
Fáry's theorem states that every simple planar graph admits an embedding in the plane such that all edges are straight line segments which don't intersect. Similarly, every simple outerplanar graph admits an embedding in the plane such that all vertices lie on a fixed circle and all edges are straight line segments that lie inside the disk and don't intersect.
A planar graph and its dual
Given an embedding G of a (not necessarily simple) connected graph in the plane without edge intersections, we construct the dual graph G* as follows: we choose one vertex in each face of G (including the outer face) and for each edge e in G we introduce a new edge in G* connecting the two vertices in G* corresponding to the two faces in G that meet at e. Furthermore, this edge is drawn so that it crosses e exactly once and that no other edge of G or G* is intersected. Then G* is again the embedding of a (not necessarily simple) planar graph; it has as many edges as G, as many vertices as G has faces and as many faces as G has vertices. The term "dual" is justified by the fact that G** = G; here the equality is the equivalence of embeddings on the sphere. If G is the planar graph corresponding to a convex polyhedron, then G* is the planar graph corresponding to the dual polyhedron.
Duals are useful because many properties of the dual graph are related in simple ways to properties of the original graph, enabling results to be proven about graphs by examining their dual graphs.
While the dual constructed for a particular embedding is unique (up to isomorphism), graphs may have different (i.e. non-isomorphic) duals, obtained from different (i.e. non-homeomorphic) embeddings.
A Euclidean graph is a graph in which the vertices represent points in the plane, and the edges are assigned lengths equal to the Euclidean distance between those points; see Geometric graph theory.
A plane graph is said to be convex if all of its faces (including the outer face) are convex polygons. A planar graph may be drawn convexly if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph.
Scheinerman's conjecture (now a theorem) states that every planar graph can be represented as an intersection graph of line segments in the plane.
The planar separator theorem states that every n-vertex planar graph can be partitioned into two subgraphs of size at most 2n/3 by the removal of O(�?i>n) vertices. As a consequence, planar graphs also have treewidth and branch-width O(�?i>n).
For two planar graphs with v vertices, it is possible to determine in time O(v) whether they are isomorphic or not (see also graph isomorphism problem).[5]
As stated above, in different contexts it may be useful to define the term graph with different degrees of generality. Whenever it is necessary to draw a strict distinction, the following terms are used. Most commonly, in modern texts in graph theory, unless stated otherwise, graph means "undirected simple finite graph" (see the definitions below).

A free tree or unrooted tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles. The vertices with one neighbor are the leaves of the tree, and the remaining vertices are the internal nodes of the tree. The degree of a vertex is its number of neighbors; in a tree with more than one node, the leaves are the vertices of degree one. An unrooted binary tree is a free tree in which all internal nodes have degree exactly three.
In some applications it may make sense to distinguish subtypes of unrooted binary trees: a planar embedding of the tree may be fixed by specifying a cyclic ordering for the edges at each vertex, making it into a plane tree. In computer science, binary trees are often rooted and ordered when they are used as data structures, but in the applications of unrooted binary trees in hierarchical clustering and evolutionary tree reconstruction, unordered trees are more common.[1]
Additionally, one may distinguish between trees in which all vertices have distinct labels, trees in which the leaves only are labeled, and trees in which the nodes are not labeled. In an unrooted binary tree with n leaves, there will be n �?#160;2 internal nodes, so the labels may be taken from the set of integers from 1 to 2n �?#160;1 when all nodes are to be labeled, or from the set of integers from 1 to n when only the leaves are to be labeled.[1]
