Example of internal and external storage

Suppose you wanted to create a linked list of families and their members. Using internal storage, the structure might look like the following:

 record member { // member of a family
     member next;
     string firstName;
     integer age;
 }
 record family { // the family itself
     family next;
     string lastName;
     string address;
     member members // head of list of members of this family
 }
