Conditionally uniform random graphs assign equal probability to all the graphs having a specified properties. They can be seen as a generalization of the Erd?s¨CR¨¦nyi model G(n,M), when the conditioning information is not necessarily the number of edges M, but whatever other arbitrary network property. In this case very few analytical results are available and simulation is required to obtain empirical distributions of average properties. Recently, a general and exact methodology for random graph simulation has been proposed by Stefano Nasini and Jordi Castro. [11]
