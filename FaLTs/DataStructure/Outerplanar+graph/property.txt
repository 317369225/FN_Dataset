Outerplanar graphs have degeneracy at most two: every subgraph of an outerplanar graph contains a vertex with degree at most two.[15]
Outerplanar graphs have treewidth at most two, which implies that many graph optimization problems that are NP-complete for arbitrary graphs may be solved in polynomial time by dynamic programming when the input is outerplanar. More generally, k-outerplanar graphs have treewidth O(k).[16]
Every outerplanar graph can be represented as an intersection graph of axis-aligned rectangles in the plane, so outerplanar graphs have boxicity at most two.[17]
A graph is outerplanar if and only if its Colin de Verdière graph invariant is at most two. The graphs characterized in a similar way by having Colin de Verdière invariant at most one, three, or four are respectively the linear forests, planar graphs, and linklessly embeddable graphs.
The full automorphism group of the butterfly graph is a group of order 8 isomorphic to the Dihedral group D4, the group of symmetries of a square, including both rotations and reflections.
The characteristic polynomial of the butterfly graph is .
Two red graphs are duals for the blue one, but they are not isomorphic.
The dual of a plane graph is a plane multigraph - multiple edges.[1] If G is a connected plane graph and if G�?is the dual of G then G is the dual of G�? Since the dual graph depends on a particular embedding, the dual graph of a planar graph is not unique in the sense that the same planar graph can have non-isomorphic dual graphs. In the picture, the red graphs are not isomorphic because the upper one has a vertex with degree 6 (the outer face).
Because of the duality, any result involving counting faces and vertices can be dualized by exchanging them.
