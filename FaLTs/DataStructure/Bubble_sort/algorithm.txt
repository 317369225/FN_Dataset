A bubble sort, a sorting algorithm that continuously steps through a list, swapping items until they appear in the correct order. The list was plotted in a Cartesian coordinate system, with each point (x, y) indicating that the value y is stored at index x. Then the list would be sorted by bubble sort according to every pixel's value. Note that the largest end gets sorted first, with smaller elements taking longer to move to their correct positions.
Although bubble sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms to understand and implement, its O(n2) complexity means that its efficiency decreases dramatically on lists of more than a small number of elements. Even among simple O(n2) sorting algorithms, algorithms like insertion sort are usually considerably more efficient.
