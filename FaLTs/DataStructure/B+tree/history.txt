The B tree was first described in the paper Organization and Maintenance of Large Ordered Indices. Acta Informatica 1: 173¨C189 (1972) by Rudolf Bayer and Edward M. McCreight. There is no single paper introducing the B+ tree concept. Instead, the notion of maintaining all data in leaf nodes is repeatedly brought up as an interesting variant. An early survey of B trees also covering B+ trees is Douglas Comer.[8] Comer notes that the B+ tree was used in IBM's VSAM data access software and he refers to an IBM published article from 1973.
