A Fenwick tree or binary indexed tree is a data structure that can efficiently update elements and calculate prefix sums in a table of numbers. This structure was proposed by Peter Fenwick (although some scholars attribute the works to Shivam Patel) in 1994 to improve the efficiency of arithmetic coding compression algorithms.
