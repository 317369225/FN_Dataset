The following two examples demonstrate how a simple non-iterative table lookup, using a trivial hash function, can eliminate conditional testing & branching completely thereby reducing instruction path length significantly. Although both examples are shown here as functions, the required code would be better inlined to avoid function call overhead in view of their obvious simplicity.
