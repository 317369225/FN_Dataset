A substring of a string {\displaystyle S} S is a string {\displaystyle S'} S' that occurs "in" {\displaystyle S} S. For example, "the best of" is a substring of "It was the best of times". This is not to be confused with subsequence, which is a generalization of substring. For example, "Itwastimes" is a subsequence of "It was the best of times", but not a substring.
