In mathematics and computer science, connectivity is one of the basic concepts of graph theory: it asks for the minimum number of elements (nodes or edges) that need to be removed to disconnect the remaining nodes from each other.[1] It is closely related to the theory of network flow problems. The connectivity of a graph is an important measure of its resilience as a network.
