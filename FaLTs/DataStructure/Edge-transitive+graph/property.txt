The Gray graph is edge-transitive and regular, but not vertex-transitive.
Edge-transitive graphs include any complete bipartite graph , and any symmetric graph, such as the vertices and edges of the cube.[1] Symmetric graphs are also vertex-transitive (if they are connected), but in general edge-transitive graphs need not be vertex-transitive. The Gray graph is an example of a graph which is edge-transitive but not vertex-transitive. All such graphs are bipartite,[1] and hence can be colored with only two colors.
An edge-transitive graph that is also regular, but not vertex-transitive, is called semi-symmetric. The Gray graph again provides an example. Every edge-transitive graph must be bipartite and either semi-symmetric or biregular.[2]

Two edges of a graph are called adjacent (sometimes coincident) if they share a common vertex. Two arrows of a directed graph are called consecutive if the head of the first one is at the nock (notch end) of the second one. Similarly, two vertices are called adjacent if they share a common edge (consecutive if they are at the notch and at the head of an arrow), in which case the common edge is said to join the two vertices. An edge and a vertex on that edge are called incident.
The graph with only one vertex and no edges is called the trivial graph. A graph with only vertices and no edges is known as an edgeless graph. The graph with no vertices and no edges is sometimes called the null graph or empty graph, but the terminology is not consistent and not all mathematicians allow this object.
In a weighted graph or digraph, each edge is associated with some value, variously called its cost, weight, length or other term depending on the application; such graphs arise in many contexts, for example in optimal routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem.
Normally, the vertices of a graph, by their nature as elements of a set, are distinguishable. This kind of graph may be called vertex-labeled. However, for many questions it is better to treat vertices as indistinguishable; then the graph may be called unlabeled. (Of course, the vertices may be still distinguishable by the properties of the graph itself, e.g., by the numbers of incident edges). The same remarks apply to edges, so graphs with labeled edges are called edge-labeled graphs. Graphs with labels attached to edges or vertices are more generally designated as labeled. Consequently, graphs in which vertices are indistinguishable and edges are indistinguishable are called unlabeled. (Note that in the literature the term labeled may apply to other kinds of labeling, besides that which serves only to distinguish different vertices or edges.)
Let A be the adjacency matrix of a graph. Then the graph is regular if and only if is an eigenvector of A.[2] Its eigenvalue will be the constant degree of the graph. Eigenvectors corresponding to other eigenvalues are orthogonal to , so for such eigenvectors , we have .
A regular graph of degree k is connected if and only if the eigenvalue k has multiplicity one.[2]
There is also a criterion for regular and connected graphs : a graph is connected and regular if and only if the matrix J, with , is in the adjacency algebra of the graph (meaning it is a linear combination of powers of A).[citation needed]
Let G be a k-regular graph with diameter D and eigenvalues of adjacency matrix . If G is not bipartite

The vertex-connectivity of a symmetric graph is always equal to the degree d.[3] In contrast, for vertex-transitive graphs in general, the vertex-connectivity is bounded below by 2(d+1)/3.[2]
A t-transitive graph of degree 3 or more has girth at least 2(t�?). However, there are no finite t-transitive graphs of degree 3 or more for t �?8. In the case of the degree being exactly 3 (cubic symmetric graphs), there are none for t �?6.
Properties of a graph G that depend only on adjacency between edges may be translated into equivalent properties in L(G) that depend on adjacency between vertices. For instance, a matching in G is a set of edges no two of which are adjacent, and corresponds to a set of vertices in L(G) no two of which are adjacent, that is, an independent set.
Thus,
The line graph of a connected graph is connected. If G is connected, it contains a path connecting any two of its edges, which translates into a path in L(G) containing any two of the vertices of L(G). However, a graph G that has some isolated vertices, and is therefore disconnected, may nevertheless have a connected line graph. A maximum independent set in a line graph corresponds to maximum matching in the original graph. Since maximum matchings may be found in polynomial time, so may the maximum independent sets of line graphs, despite the hardness of the maximum independent set problem for more general families of graphs. The edge chromatic number of a graph G is equal to the vertex chromatic number of its line graph L(G). The line graph of an edge-transitive graph is vertex-transitive. If a graph G has an Euler cycle, that is, if G is connected and has an even number of edges at each vertex, then the line graph of G is Hamiltonian. (However, not all Hamiltonian cycles in line graphs come from Euler cycles in this way.) Line graphs are claw-free graphs, graphs without an induced subgraph in the form of a three-leaf tree. The line graphs of trees are exactly the claw-free block graph.
The full automorphism group of the butterfly graph is a group of order 8 isomorphic to the Dihedral group D4, the group of symmetries of a square, including both rotations and reflections.
The characteristic polynomial of the butterfly graph is .
If a member of the generating set is its own inverse, , then it is generally represented by an undirected edge.
The Cayley graph depends in an essential way on the choice of the set of generators. For example, if the generating set has elements then each vertex of the Cayley graph has incoming and outgoing directed edges. In the case of a symmetric generating set with elements, the Cayley graph is a regular graph of degree
Cycles (or closed walks) in the Cayley graph indicate relations between the elements of In the more elaborate construction of the Cayley complex of a group, closed paths corresponding to relations are "filled in" by polygons. This means that the problem of constructing the Cayley graph of a given presentation is equivalent to solving the Word Problem for .[1]
If is a surjective group homomorphism and the images of the elements of the generating set for are distinct, then it induces a covering of graphs

where
In particular, if a group has generators, all of order different from 2, and the set consists of these generators together with their inverses, then the Cayley graph is covered by the infinite regular tree of degree corresponding to the free group on the same set of generators.
A graph can be constructed even if the set does not generate the group However, it is disconnected and is not considered to be a Cayley graph. In this case, each connected component of the graph represents a coset of the subgroup generated by .
For any finite Cayley graph, considered as undirected, the vertex connectivity is at least equal to 2/3 of the degree of the graph. If the generating set is minimal (removal of any element and, if present, its inverse from the generating set leaves a set which is not generating), the vertex connectivity is equal to the degree. The edge connectivity is in all cases equal to the degree.[4]
Cographs may be recognized in linear time, and a cotree representation constructed, using modular decomposition (Corneil, Perl & Stewart 1985), partition refinement (Habib & Paul 2005), or split decomposition (Gioan & Paul 2008). Once a cotree representation has been constructed, many familiar graph problems may be solved via simple bottom-up calculations on the cotrees.
For instance, to find the maximum clique in a cograph, compute in bottom-up order the maximum clique in each subgraph represented by a subtree of the cotree. For a node labeled 0, the maximum clique is the maximum among the cliques computed for that node's children. For a node labeled 1, the maximum clique is the union of the cliques computed for that node's children, and has size equal to the sum of the children's clique sizes. Thus, by alternately maximizing and summing values stored at each node of the cotree, we may compute the maximum clique size, and by alternately maximizing and taking unions, we may construct the maximum clique itself. Similar bottom-up tree computations allow the maximum independent set, vertex coloring number, maximum clique cover, and Hamiltonicity (that is the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle) to be computed in linear time from a cotree representation of a cograph. One can also use cotrees to determine in linear time whether two cographs are isomorphic.
If H is an induced subgraph of a cograph G, then H is itself a cograph; the cotree for H may be formed by removing some of the leaves from the cotree for G and then suppressing nodes that have only one child. It follows from Kruskal's tree theorem that the relation of being an induced subgraph is a well-quasi-ordering on the cographs (Damaschke 1990). Thus, if a subfamily of the cographs (such as the planar cographs) is closed under induced subgraph operations then it has a finite number of forbidden induced subgraphs. Computationally, this means that testing membership in such a subfamily may be performed in linear time, by using a bottom-up computation on the cotree of a given graph to test whether it contains any of these forbidden subgraphs.
Given a bipartite graph, finding its complete bipartite subgraph Km,n with maximal number of edges mn is an NP-complete problem. A planar graph cannot contain K3,3 as a minor; an outerplanar graph cannot contain K3,2 as a minor (These are not sufficient conditions for planarity and outerplanarity, but necessary). A complete bipartite graph. Kn,n is a Moore graph and a (n,4)-cage. A complete bipartite graph Kn,n or Kn,n+1 is a Turán graph. A complete bipartite graph Km,n has a vertex covering number of min{m,n} and an edge covering number of max{m,n}. A complete bipartite graph Km,n has a maximum independent set of size max{m,n}. The adjacency matrix of a complete bipartite graph Km,n has eigenvalues �?nm), −√(nm) and 0; with multiplicity 1, 1 and n+m�? respectively. The laplacian matrix of a complete bipartite graph Km,n has eigenvalues n+m, n, m, and 0; with multiplicity 1, m�?, n�? and 1 respectively. A complete bipartite graph Km,n has mn�? nm�? spanning trees. A complete bipartite graph Km,n has a maximum matching of size min{m,n}. A complete bipartite graph Kn,n has a proper n-edge-coloring corresponding to a Latin square. The last two results are corollaries of the Marriage Theorem as applied to a k-regular bipartite graph.
The complete graph on n vertices is denoted by Kn.  Some sources claim that the letter K in this notation stands for the German word komplett,[2] but the German name for a complete graph, vollständiger Graph, does not contain the letter K, and other sources state that the notation honors the contributions of Kazimierz Kuratowski to graph theory.[3]
Kn has n(n �?1)/2 edges (a triangular number), and is a regular graph of degree n �?1.  All complete graphs are their own maximal cliques.  They are maximally connected as the only vertex cut which disconnects the graph is the complete set of vertices.  The complement graph of a complete graph is an empty graph.
If the edges of a complete graph are each given an orientation, the resulting directed graph is called a tournament.
The number of matchings of the complete graphs are given by the telephone numbers
1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 26, 76, 232, 764, 2620, 9496, ... (sequence A000085 in OEIS).
These numbers give the largest possible value of the Hosoya index for an n-vertex graph.[4]
Connectedness is preserved by graph homomorphisms.
If G is connected then its line graph L(G) is also connected.
A graph G is 2-edge-connected if and only if it has an orientation that is strongly connected.
Balinski's theorem states that the polytopal graph (1-skeleton) of a -dimensional convex polytope is a -vertex-connected graph.[7] As a partial converse, Steinitz showed that any 3-vertex-connected planar graph is a polytopal graph (Steinitz theorem).
According to a theorem of G. A. Dirac, if a graph is k-connected for k �?#160;2, then for every set of k vertices in the graph there is a cycle that passes through all the vertices in the set.[8][9] The converse is true when k = 2.
A cycle graph is:
Connected 2-regular Eulerian Hamiltonian 2-vertex colorable, if and only if it has an even number of vertices. More generally, a graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycles (Kőnig, 1936). 2-edge colorable, if and only if it has an even number of vertices 3-vertex colorable and 3-edge colorable, for any number of vertices A unit distance graph
In addition:
As cycle graphs can be drawn as regular polygons, the symmetries of an n-cycle are the same as those of a regular polygon with n sides, the dihedral group of order 2n. In particular, there exist symmetries taking any vertex to any other vertex, and any edge to any other edge, so the n-cycle is a symmetric graph.
Two red graphs are duals for the blue one, but they are not isomorphic.
The dual of a plane graph is a plane multigraph - multiple edges.[1] If G is a connected plane graph and if G�?is the dual of G then G is the dual of G�? Since the dual graph depends on a particular embedding, the dual graph of a planar graph is not unique in the sense that the same planar graph can have non-isomorphic dual graphs. In the picture, the red graphs are not isomorphic because the upper one has a vertex with degree 6 (the outer face).
Because of the duality, any result involving counting faces and vertices can be dualized by exchanging them.
The Gray graph is edge-transitive and regular, but not vertex-transitive.
Edge-transitive graphs include any complete bipartite graph , and any symmetric graph, such as the vertices and edges of the cube.[1] Symmetric graphs are also vertex-transitive (if they are connected), but in general edge-transitive graphs need not be vertex-transitive. The Gray graph is an example of a graph which is edge-transitive but not vertex-transitive. All such graphs are bipartite,[1] and hence can be colored with only two colors.
An edge-transitive graph that is also regular, but not vertex-transitive, is called semi-symmetric. The Gray graph again provides an example. Every edge-transitive graph must be bipartite and either semi-symmetric or biregular.[2]

Two edges of a graph are called adjacent (sometimes coincident) if they share a common vertex. Two arrows of a directed graph are called consecutive if the head of the first one is at the nock (notch end) of the second one. Similarly, two vertices are called adjacent if they share a common edge (consecutive if they are at the notch and at the head of an arrow), in which case the common edge is said to join the two vertices. An edge and a vertex on that edge are called incident.
The graph with only one vertex and no edges is called the trivial graph. A graph with only vertices and no edges is known as an edgeless graph.

(Note that in the literature the term labeled may apply to other kinds of labeling, besides that which serves only to distinguish different vertices or edges.)
The automorphism group of the Gray graph is a group of order 1296. It acts transitively on the edges the graph but not on its vertices : there are symmetries taking every edge to any other edge, but not taking every vertex to any other vertex. The vertices that correspond to points of the underlying configuration can only be symmetric to other vertices that correspond to points, and the vertices that correspond to lines can only be symmetric to other vertices that correspond to lines. Therefore, the Gray graph is a semi-symmetric graph, the smallest possible cubic semi-symmetric graph.
The characteristic polynomial of the Gray graph is

The Heawood graph is a toroidal graph; that is, it can be embedded without crossings onto a torus. One embedding of this type places its vertices and edges into three-dimensional Euclidean space as the set of vertices and edges of a nonconvex polyhedron with the topology of a torus, the Szilassi polyhedron.
The graph is named after Percy John Heawood, who in 1890 proved that in every subdivision of the torus into polygons, the polygonal regions can be colored by at most seven colors.[5][6] The Heawood graph forms a subdivision of the torus with seven mutually adjacent regions, showing that this bound is tight.
The Heawood graph is also the Levi graph of the Fano plane, the graph representing incidences between points and lines in that geometry. With this interpretation, the 6-cycles in the Heawood graph correspond to triangles in the Fano plane.
The Heawood graph has crossing number 3, and is the smallest cubic graph with that crossing number (sequence A110507 in OEIS). Including the Heawood graph, there are 8 distinct graphs of order 14 with crossing number 3.
The Heawood graph is a unit distance graph: it can be embedded in the plane such that adjacent vertices are exactly at distance one apart, with no two vertices embedded to the same point and no vertex embedded into a point within an edge. However, the known embeddings of this type lack any of the symmetries that are inherent in the graph.[7]
A square grid graph is a Cartesian product of graphs, namely, of two path graphs with n - 1 and m - 1 edges.[2] Since a path graph is a median graph, the latter fact implies that the square grid graph is also a median graph. All grid graphs are bipartite.
A path graph may also be considered to be a grid graph on the grid n times 1. A 2x2 grid graph is a 4-cycle.[2]
Properties of a graph G that depend only on adjacency between edges may be translated into equivalent properties in L(G) that depend on adjacency between vertices. For instance, a matching in G is a set of edges no two of which are adjacent, and corresponds to a set of vertices in L(G) no two of which are adjacent, that is, an independent set.
Thus,
The line graph of a connected graph is connected. If G is connected, it contains a path connecting any two of its edges, which translates into a path in L(G) containing any two of the vertices of L(G). However, a graph G that has some isolated vertices, and is therefore disconnected, may nevertheless have a connected line graph. A maximum independent set in a line graph corresponds to maximum matching in the original graph. Since maximum matchings may be found in polynomial time, so may the maximum independent sets of line graphs, despite the hardness of the maximum independent set problem for more general families of graphs. The edge chromatic number of a graph G is equal to the vertex chromatic number of its line graph L(G). The line graph of an edge-transitive graph is vertex-transitive. If a graph G has an Euler cycle, that is, if G is connected and has an even number of edges at each vertex, then the line graph of G is Hamiltonian. (However, not all Hamiltonian cycles in line graphs come from Euler cycles in this way.) Line graphs are claw-free graphs, graphs without an induced subgraph in the form of a three-leaf tree. The line graphs of trees are exactly the claw-free block graph.
The automorphism group of the Ljubljana graph is a group of order 168. It acts transitively on the edges the graph but not on its vertices : there are symmetries taking every edge to any other edge, but not taking every vertex to any other vertex. Therefore, the Ljubljana graph is a semi-symmetric graph, the third smallest possible cubic semi-symmetric graph after the Gray graph on 54 vertices and the Iofinova-Ivanov graph on 110 vertices.[3]
The characteristic polynomial of the Ljubljana graph is

The Cartesian product of graphs forms a median graph from two smaller median graphs.
The Cartesian product of any two median graphs is another median graph.  Medians in the product graph may be computed by independently finding the medians in the two factors, just as medians in grid graphs may be computed by independently finding the median in each linear dimension.
The windex of a graph measures the amount of lookahead needed to optimally solve a problem in which one is given a sequence of graph vertices si, and must find as output another sequence of vertices ti minimizing the sum of the distances d(si,ti) and d(ti �?#160;1,ti).  Median graphs are exactly the graphs that have windex 2.  In a median graph, the optimal choice is to set ti = m(ti �?#160;1,si,si + 1).[1]
The property of having a unique median is also called the unique Steiner point property.[1]  An optimal Steiner tree for any three vertices a, b, and c in a median graph may be found as the union of three shortest paths, from a, b, and c to m(a,b,c).  Bandelt & Barthélémy (1984) study more generally the problem of finding the vertex minimizing the sum of distances to each of a given set of vertices, and show that it has a unique solution for any odd number of vertices in a median graph.  They also show that this median of a set S of vertices in a median graph satisfies the Condorcet criterion for the winner of an election: compared to any other vertex, it is closer to a majority of the vertices in S.
As with partial cubes more generally, any median graph with n vertices has at most (n/2) log2 n edges.  However, the number of edges cannot be too small: Klavžar, Mulder & Škrekovski (1998) prove that in any median graph the inequality 2n �?#160;m �?#160;k �?#160;2 holds, where m is the number of edges and k is the dimension of the hypercube that the graph is a retract of.  This inequality is an equality if and only if the median graph contains no cubes.  This is a consequence of another identity for median graphs: the Euler characteristic Σ (-1)dim(Q) is always equal to one, where the sum is taken over all hypercube subgraphs Q of the given median graph.[24]
The only regular median graphs are the hypercubes.[25]
For any cycle C in the graph, if the weight of an edge e of C is larger than the weights of all other edges of C, then this edge cannot belong to an MST. Assuming the contrary, i.e. that e belongs to an MST T1, then deleting e will break T1 into two subtrees with the two ends of e in different subtrees. The remainder of C reconnects the subtrees, hence there is an edge f of C with ends in different subtrees, i.e., it reconnects the subtrees into a tree T2 with weight less than that of T1, because the weight of f is less than the weight of e.
For any cycle C in the graph, if the weight of an edge e of C is larger than the weights of all other edges of C, then this edge cannot belong to an MST.

A symmetric embedding of the Nauru graph on a genus-4 surface, with six dodecagonal faces.
The Nauru graph has two different embeddings as generalized regular polyhedra: topological surfaces partitioned into edges, vertices, and faces in such a way that there is a symmetry taking any flag (an incident triple of a vertex, edge, and face) into any other flag.[7]
One of these two embeddings forms a torus, so the Nauru graph is a toroidal graph: it consists of 12 hexagonal faces together with the 24 vertices and 36 edges of the Nauru graph. The dual graph of this embedding is a symmetric 6-regular graph with 12 vertices and 36 edges.
The other symmetric embedding of the Nauru graph has six dodecagonal faces, and forms a surface of genus 4. Its dual is not a simple graph, since each face shares three edges with four other faces, but a multigraph. This dual can be formed from the graph of a regular octahedron by replacing each edge with a bundle of three parallel edges.
The set of faces of any one of these two embeddings is the set of Petrie polygons of the other embedding.
The automorphism group of the Pappus graph is a group of order 216. It acts transitively on the vertices, on the edges and on the arcs of the graph. Therefore the Pappus graph is a symmetric graph. It has automorphisms that take any vertex to any other vertex and any edge to any other edge. According to the Foster census, the Pappus graph, referenced as F018A, is the only cubic symmetric graph on 18 vertices.[4][5]
The characteristic polynomial of the Pappus graph is . It is the only graph with this characteristic polynomial, making it a graph determined by its spectrum.
The Petersen graph:
is 3-connected and hence 3-edge-connected and bridgeless. See the glossary. has independence number 4 and is 3-partite. See the glossary. is cubic, has domination number 3, and has a perfect matching and a 2-factor. is the smallest cubic graph of girth 5. (It is the unique -cage. In fact, since it has only 10 vertices, it is the unique -Moore graph.)[9] has radius 2 and diameter 2. It is the largest cubic graph with diameter 2.[10] has graph spectrum �?, �?, �?, �?, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3. has 2000 spanning trees, the most of any 10-vertex cubic graph.[11] has chromatic polynomial [12] has characteristic polynomial , making it an integral graph—a graph whose spectrum consists entirely of integers.
The theory of random graphs studies typical properties of random graphs, those that hold with high probability for graphs drawn from a particular distribution. For example, we might ask for a given value of and what the probability is that is connected. In studying such questions, researchers often concentrate on the asymptotic behavior of random graphs—the values that various probabilities converge to as grows very large. Percolation theory characterizes the connectedness of random graphs, especially infinitely large ones.
Percolation is related to the robustness of the graph (called also network). Given a random graph of n nodes and an average degree . Next we remove randomly a fraction of nodes and leave only a fraction . There exists a critical percolation threshold below which the network becomes fragmented while above a giant connected component exists [1] [3] [4] [5] [6] .[7]
(threshold functions, evolution of G~)
Random graphs are widely used in the probabilistic method, where one tries to prove the existence of graphs with certain properties. The existence of a property on a random graph can often imply, via the famous Szemerédi regularity lemma, the existence of that property on almost all graphs.
As with more general random graphs, it is possible to prove that certain properties of random r-regular graphs hold almost surely. In particular, a random r-regular graph is almost surely r-connected.[2] In other words, although r-regular graphs with connectivity less than r exist, the probability of selecting such a graph tends to 0 as n increases.
If > 0 is a positive constant, and d is the least integer satisfying

then, almost surely, a random r-regular graph has diameter at most d. There is also a (more complex) lower bound on the diameter of r-regular graphs, so that almost all r-regular graphs (of the same size) have almost the same diameter.[3]
The distribution of the number of short cycles is also known: for fixed m �?3, let Y3,Y4,�?Ym be the number of cycles of lengths up to m. Then the Yi are asymptotically independent Poisson random variables with means[4]

The number of size-n recursive trees is given by

Hence the exponential generating function T(z) of the sequence Tn is given by

Combinatorically a recursive tree can be interpreted as a root followed by an unordered sequence of recursive trees. Let F denote the family of recursive trees.

By translation of the formal description one obtains the differential equation for T(z)

Let A be the adjacency matrix of a graph. Then the graph is regular if and only if is an eigenvector of A.[2] Its eigenvalue will be the constant degree of the graph. Eigenvectors corresponding to other eigenvalues are orthogonal to , so for such eigenvectors , we have .
A regular graph of degree k is connected if and only if the eigenvalue k has multiplicity one.[2]
There is also a criterion for regular and connected graphs : a graph is connected and regular if and only if the matrix J, with , is in the adjacency algebra of the graph (meaning it is a linear combination of powers of A).[citation needed]
Let G be a k-regular graph with diameter D and eigenvalues of adjacency matrix . If G is not bipartite

Every series-parallel graph has treewidth at most 2 and branchwidth at most 2. Indeed, a graph has treewidth at most 2 if and only if it has branchwidth at most 2, if and only if every biconnected component is a series-parallel graph.[3][4] The maximal series-parallel graphs, graphs to which no additional edges can be added without destroying their series-parallel structure, are exactly the 2-trees. Graphs of treewidth at most 2 have an explicit forbidden minor characterization, implying that a graph is series-parallel if and only if its biconnected components are linked in a path and it excludes the complete graph K4 as a minor.
Series parallel graphs may also be characterized by their ear decompositions.[1]

Two edges of a graph are called adjacent (sometimes coincident) if they share a common vertex. Two arrows of a directed graph are called consecutive if the head of the first one is at the nock (notch end) of the second one. Similarly, two vertices are called adjacent if they share a common edge (consecutive if they are at the notch and at the head of an arrow), in which case the common edge is said to join the two vertices. An edge and a vertex on that edge are called incident.
The graph with only one vertex and no edges is called the trivial graph. A graph with only vertices and no edges is known as an edgeless graph. The graph with no vertices and no edges is sometimes called the null graph or empty graph, but the terminology is not consistent and not all mathematicians allow this object.
In a weighted graph or digraph, each edge is associated with some value, variously called its cost, weight, length or other term depending on the application; such graphs arise in many contexts, for example in optimal routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem.
Normally, the vertices of a graph, by their nature as elements of a set, are distinguishable. This kind of graph may be called vertex-labeled. However, for many questions it is better to treat vertices as indistinguishable; then the graph may be called unlabeled. (Of course, the vertices may be still distinguishable by the properties of the graph itself, e.g., by the numbers of incident edges). The same remarks apply to edges, so graphs with labeled edges are called edge-labeled graphs. Graphs with labels attached to edges or vertices are more generally designated as labeled. Consequently, graphs in which vertices are indistinguishable and edges are indistinguishable are called unlabeled. (Note that in the literature the term labeled may apply to other kinds of labeling, besides that which serves only to distinguish different vertices or edges.)
The four parameters in an srg(v,k,λ,μ) are not independent and must obey the following relation:

The above relation can be derived very easily through a counting argument as follows:
Imagine the nodes of the graph to lie in three levels. Pick any node as the root node, in Level 0. Then its k neighbor nodes lie in Level 1, and all other nodes lie in Level 2. Nodes in Level 1 are directly connected to the root, hence they must have other neighbors in common with the root, and these common neighbors must also be in Level 1. Since each node has degree k, there are edges remaining for each Level 1 node to connect to nodes in Level 2. Nodes in Level 2 are not directly connected to the root, hence they must have common neighbors with the root, and these common neighbors must all be in Level 1. Therefore nodes in Level 1 are connected to each node in Level 2 and each of the k nodes in Level 1 is connected to nodes in Level 2. Therefore the number of nodes in Level 2 is . The total number of nodes across all three levels is therefore and by rearranging we get . QED
Let I denote the identity matrix (of order v) and let J denote the matrix whose entries all equal 1. The adjacency matrix A of a strongly regular graph satisfies these properties : (This is a trivial restatement of the vertex degree requirement). (The first term gives the number of 2-step paths from each vertex to all vertices. For the vertex pairs directly connected by an edge, the equation reduces to the number of such 2-step paths being equal to . For the vertex pairs not directly connected by an edge, the equation reduces to the number of such 2-step paths being equal to . For the trivial self-pairs, the equation reduces to the degree being equal to k).
The graph has exactly three eigenvalues: whose multiplicity is 1 whose multiplicity is whose multiplicity is
Strongly regular graphs for which are called conference graphs because of their connection with symmetric conference matrices. Their parameters reduce to .
Strongly regular graphs for which have integer eigenvalues with unequal multiplicities.
The complement of an srg(v,k,λ,μ) is also strongly regular. It is an srg(v, v−k�?, v�?�?k+μ, v�?k+λ).
The vertex-connectivity of a symmetric graph is always equal to the degree d.[3] In contrast, for vertex-transitive graphs in general, the vertex-connectivity is bounded below by 2(d+1)/3.[2]
A t-transitive graph of degree 3 or more has girth at least 2(t�?). However, there are no finite t-transitive graphs of degree 3 or more for t �?8. In the case of the degree being exactly 3 (cubic symmetric graphs), there are none for t �?6.

Two edges of a graph are called adjacent (sometimes coincident) if they share a common vertex. Two arrows of a directed graph are called consecutive if the head of the first one is at the nock (notch end) of the second one. Similarly, two vertices are called adjacent if they share a common edge (consecutive if they are at the notch and at the head of an arrow), in which case the common edge is said to join the two vertices. An edge and a vertex on that edge are called incident.
The graph with only one vertex and no edges is called the trivial graph. A graph with only vertices and no edges is known as an edgeless graph. The graph with no vertices and no edges is sometimes called the null graph or empty graph, but the terminology is not consistent and not all mathematicians allow this object.
In a weighted graph or digraph, each edge is associated with some value, variously called its cost, weight, length or other term depending on the application; such graphs arise in many contexts, for example in optimal routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem.
Normally, the vertices of a graph, by their nature as elements of a set, are distinguishable. This kind of graph may be called vertex-labeled. However, for many questions it is better to treat vertices as indistinguishable; then the graph may be called unlabeled. (Of course, the vertices may be still distinguishable by the properties of the graph itself, e.g., by the numbers of incident edges). The same remarks apply to edges, so graphs with labeled edges are called edge-labeled graphs. Graphs with labels attached to edges or vertices are more generally designated as labeled. Consequently, graphs in which vertices are indistinguishable and edges are indistinguishable are called unlabeled. (Note that in the literature the term labeled may apply to other kinds of labeling, besides that which serves only to distinguish different vertices or edges.)
