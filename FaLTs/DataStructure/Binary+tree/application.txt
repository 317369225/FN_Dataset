In computing, binary trees are seldom used solely for their structure. Much more typical is to define a labeling function on the nodes, which associates some value to each node.[7] Binary trees labelled this way are used to implement binary search trees and binary heaps, and are used for efficient searching and sorting. The designation of non-root nodes as left or right child even when there is only one child present matters in some of these applications, in particular it is significant in binary search trees.[8] In mathematics, what is termed binary tree can vary significantly from author to author. Some use the definition commonly used in computer science,[9] but others define it as every non-leaf having exactly two children and don't necessarily order (as left/right) the children either.[10]
Binary trees are used for many things, ranging from efficient searching techniques, data compression, and even arithmetic expression parsers (simple compilers).
