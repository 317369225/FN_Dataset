Theoretical computer science includes areas of discrete mathematics relevant to computing. 
Information theory involves the quantification of information.
Logic is the study of the principles of valid reasoning and inference, as well as of consistency, soundness, and completeness.
Set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets, which are collections of objects, such as {blue, white, red} or the (infinite) set of all prime numbers. 
Combinatorics studies the way in which discrete structures can be combined or arranged.
Graph theory, the study of graphs and networks, is often considered part of combinatorics, but has grown large enough and distinct enough, with its own kind of problems, to be regarded as a subject in its own right.
Discrete probability theory deals with events that occur in countable sample spaces. 
Number theory is concerned with the properties of numbers in general, particularly integers.
Algebraic structures occur as both discrete examples and continuous examples. 
A function defined on an interval of the integers is usually called a sequence. 
Discrete geometry and combinatorial geometry are about combinatorial properties of discrete collections of geometrical objects.
Although topology is the field of mathematics that formalizes and generalizes the intuitive notion of "continuous deformation" of objects, it gives rise to many discrete topics
Operations research provides techniques for solving practical problems in engineering, business, and other fields 
Game theory, decision theory, utility theory, social choice theory
Discretization concerns the process of transferring continuous models and equations into discrete counterparts, often for the purposes of making calculations easier by using approximations.
There are many concepts in continuous mathematics which have discrete versions
The time scale calculus is a unification of the theory of difference equations with that of differential equations,
