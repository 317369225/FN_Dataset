The study of mathematical proof is particularly important in logic, and has applications to automated theorem proving and formal verification of software.
Partially ordered sets and sets with other relations have applications in several areas.
 It has applications to cryptography, cryptanalysis, and cryptology, particularly with regard to modular arithmetic, diophantine equations, linear and quadratic congruences, prime numbers and primality testing.
 Petri nets and process algebras are used to model computer systems, and methods from discrete mathematics are used in analyzing VLSI electronic circuits.
