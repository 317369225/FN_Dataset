Several pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* search algorithm, internally build a spanning tree as an intermediate step in solving the problem.
In order to minimize the cost of power networks, wiring connections, piping, automatic speech recognition, etc., people often use algorithms that gradually build a spanning tree (or many such trees) as intermediate steps in the process of finding the minimum spanning tree.[1]
The Internet and many other telecommunications networks have transmission links that connect nodes together in a mesh topology that includes some loops. In order to "avoid bridge loops and "routing loops", many routing protocols designed for such networks -- including the Spanning Tree Protocol, Open Shortest Path First, Link-state routing protocol, Augmented tree-based routing, etc. -- require each router to remember a spanning tree.
