Main article: Operations on graphs
There are several operations that produce new graphs from old ones, which might be classified into the following categories:
Elementary operations, sometimes called "editing operations" on graphs, which create a new graph from the original one by a simple, local change, such as addition or deletion of a vertex or an edge, merging and splitting of vertices, etc. Graph rewrite operations replacing the occurrence of some pattern graph within the host graph by an instance of the corresponding replacement graph. Unary operations, which create a significantly new graph from the old one. Examples: Line graph Dual graph Complement graph Binary operations, which create new graph from two initial graphs. Examples: Disjoint union of graphs Cartesian product of graphs Tensor product of graphs Strong product of graphs Lexicographic product of graphs
