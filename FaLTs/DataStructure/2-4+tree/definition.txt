In computer science, a 2¨C3¨C4 tree (also called a 2¨C4 tree) is a self-balancing data structure that is commonly used to implement dictionaries.[citation needed] The numbers mean a tree where every node with children (internal node) has either two, three, or four child nodes:

a 2-node has one data element, and if internal has two child nodes;
a 3-node has two data elements, and if internal has three child nodes;
a 4-node has three data elements, and if internal has four child nodes.
