The hash array mapped trie achieves almost hash table-like speed while using memory much more economically. Also, a hash table may have to be periodically resized, an expensive operation, whereas HAMTs grow dynamically. Generally, HAMT performance is improved by a larger root table with some multiple of N slots; some HAMT variants allow the root to grow lazily[1] with negligible impact on performance.
