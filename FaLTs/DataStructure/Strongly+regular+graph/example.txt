A strongly regular graph is called primitive if both the graph and its complement are connected. All the above graphs are primitive, as otherwise μ=0 or μ=k.
Complete graphs are distance regular with diameter 1 and degree v�?. Cycles C2d+1 of odd length are distance regular with k = 2 and diameter d. The intersection numbers ai = 0, bi = 1, and ci = 1, except for the usual special cases (see above) and cd = 2. All Moore graphs, in particular the Petersen graph and the Hoffman-Singleton graph, are distance regular. Strongly regular graphs are distance regular. The odd graphs are distance regular.
A graph with six nodes.
The diagram at right is a graphic representation of the following graph:
V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} E = {{1, 2}, {1, 5}, {2, 3}, {2, 5}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {4, 6}}.
In category theory a small category can be represented by a directed multigraph in which the objects of the category represented as vertices and the morphisms as directed edges. Then, the functors between categories induce some, but not necessarily all, of the digraph morphisms of the graph. In computer science, directed graphs are used to represent knowledge (e.g., Conceptual graph), finite state machines, and many other discrete structures. A binary relation R on a set X defines a directed graph. An element x of X is a direct predecessor of an element y of X iff xRy.
If every circle belongs to B, and there are no half-edges, Ω is balanced. A balanced biased graph is (for most purposes) essentially the same as an ordinary graph.
If B is empty, Ω is called contrabalanced. Contrabalanced biased graphs are related to bicircular matroids.
If B consists of the circles of even length, Ω is called antibalanced and is the biased graph obtained from an all-negative signed graph.
The linear class B is additive, that is, closed under repeated symmetric difference (when the result is a circle), if and only if B is the class of positive circles of a signed graph.
Ω may have underlying graph that is a cycle of length n �?3 with all edges doubled. Call this a biased 2Cn . Such biased graphs in which no digon (circle of length 2) is balanced lead to spikes and swirls (see Matroids, below).
Some kinds of biased graph are obtained from gain graphs or are generalizations of special kinds of gain graph. The latter include biased expansion graphs, which generalize group expansion graphs.

The left figure below shows a binary decision tree (the reduction rules are not applied), and a truth table, each representing the function f (x1, x2, x3). In the tree on the left, the value of the function can be determined for a given variable assignment by following a path down the graph to a terminal. In the figures below, dotted lines represent edges to a low child, while solid lines represent edges to a high child. Therefore, to find (x1=0, x2=1, x3=1), begin at x1, traverse down the dotted line to x2 (since x1 has an assignment to 0), then down two solid lines (since x2 and x3 each have an assignment to one). This leads to the terminal 1, which is the value of f (x1=0, x2=1, x3=1).
The binary decision tree of the left figure can be transformed into a binary decision diagram by maximally reducing it according to the two reduction rules. The resulting BDD is shown in the right figure.

When modelling relations between two different classes of objects, bipartite graphs very often arise naturally. For instance, a graph of football players and clubs, with an edge between a player and a club if the player has played for that club, is a natural example of an affiliation network, a type of bipartite graph used in social network analysis.[6]
Another example where bipartite graphs appear naturally is in the (NP-complete) railway optimization problem, in which the input is a schedule of trains and their stops, and the goal is to find as small a set of train stations as possible such that every train visits at least one of the chosen stations. This problem can be modeled as a dominating set problem in a bipartite graph that has a vertex for each train and each station and an edge for each pair of a station and a train that stops at that station.[7]
More abstract examples include the following:
Every tree is bipartite.[4] Cycle graphs with an even number of vertices are bipartite.[4] Every planar graph whose faces all have even length is bipartite.[8] Special cases of this are grid graphs and squaregraphs, in which every inner face consists of 4 edges and every inner vertex has four or more neighbors.[9] The complete bipartite graph on n and m vertices, denoted by Kn,m is the bipartite graph G = (V, U, E), where V and U are disjoint sets of size n and m, respectively, and E connects every vertex in V with all vertices in U. It follows that Kn,m has nm edges.[10] Closely related to the complete bipartite graphs are the crown graphs, formed from complete bipartite graphs by removing the edges of a perfect matching.[11] Hypercube graphs, partial cubes, and median graphs are bipartite. In these graphs, the vertices may be labeled by bitvectors, in such a way that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding bitvectors differ in a single position. A bipartition may be formed by separating the vertices whose bitvectors have an even number of ones from the vertices with an odd number of ones. Trees and squaregraphs form examples of median graphs, and every median graph is a partial cube.[12]
Suppose that is the infinite cyclic group and the set S consists of the standard generator 1 and its inverse (�? in the additive notation) then the Cayley graph is an infinite chain.
Similarly, if is the finite cyclic group of order n and the set S consists of two elements, the standard generator of G and its inverse, then the Cayley graph is the cycle .
The Cayley graph of the direct product of groups is the cartesian product of the corresponding Cayley graphs[citation needed]. Thus the Cayley graph of the abelian group with the set of generators consisting of four elements is the infinite grid on the plane , while for the direct product with similar generators the Cayley graph is the finite grid on a torus.
Cayley graph of the dihedral group Dih4 on two generators a and b
On two generators of Dih4, which are both self-inverse
A Cayley graph of the dihedral group D4 on two generators a and b is depicted to the left. Red arrows represent left-multiplication by element a. Since element b is self-inverse, the blue lines which represent left-multiplication by element b are undirected. Therefore the graph is mixed: it has eight vertices, eight arrows, and four edges. The Cayley table of the group D4 can be derived from the group presentation


A different Cayley graph of Dih4 is shown on the right. b is still the horizontal reflection and represented by blue lines; c is a diagonal reflection and represented by green lines. As both reflections are self-inverse the Cayley graph on the right is completely undirected. This graph corresponds to the presentation


The Cayley graph of the free group on two generators a, b corresponding to the set S = {a, b, a�?, b�?} is depicted at the top of the article, and e represents the identity element. Travelling along an edge to the right represents right multiplication by a, while travelling along an edge upward corresponds to the multiplication by b. Since the free group has no relations, the Cayley graph has no cycles. This Cayley graph is a key ingredient in the proof of the Banach–Tarski paradox.
Part of a Cayley graph of the Heisenberg group. (The coloring is only for visual aid.)
A Cayley graph of the discrete Heisenberg group
is depicted to the right. The generators used in the picture are the three matrices X, Y, Z given by the three permutations of 1, 0, 0 for the entries x, y, z. They satisfy the relations , which can also be read off from the picture. This is a non-commutative infinite group, and despite being three-dimensional in some sense, the Cayley graph has four-dimensional volume growth.
Several graph-theoretic concepts are related to each other via complement graphs:
The complement of an edgeless graph is a complete graph and vice versa. An independent set in a graph is a clique in the complement graph and vice versa. The complement of any triangle-free graph is a claw-free graph. A self-complementary graph is a graph that is isomorphic to its own complement. Cographs are defined as the graphs that can be built up from disjoint union and complementation operations, and form a self-complementary family of graphs: the complement of any cograph is another (possibly different) cograph.
The star graphs S3, S4, S5 and S6.
The utility graph K3,3
For any k, K1,k is called a star. All complete bipartite graphs which are trees are stars. The graph K1,3 is called a claw, and is used to define the claw-free graphs. The graph K3,3 is called the utility graph. This usage comes from a standard mathematical puzzle in which three utilities must each be connected to three buildings; it is impossible to solve without crossings due to the nonplanarity of K3,3.
Complete graphs on n vertices, for n between 1 and 12, are shown below along with the numbers of edges:
K1: 0 K2: 1 K3: 3 K4: 6 K5: 10 K6: 15 K7: 21 K8: 28 K9: 36 K10: 45 K11: 55 K12: 66
The vertex- and edge-connectivities of a disconnected graph are both 0. 1-connectedness is synonymous with connectedness. The complete graph on n vertices has edge-connectivity equal to n �?1. Every other simple graph on n vertices has strictly smaller edge-connectivity. In a tree, the local edge-connectivity between every pair of vertices is 1.
Complete graphs are distance regular with diameter 1 and degree v�?. Cycles C2d+1 of odd length are distance regular with k = 2 and diameter d. The intersection numbers ai = 0, bi = 1, and ci = 1, except for the usual special cases (see above) and cd = 2. All Moore graphs, in particular the Petersen graph and the Hoffman-Singleton graph, are distance regular. Strongly regular graphs are distance regular. The odd graphs are distance regular.
The Gray graph is edge-transitive and regular, but not vertex-transitive.
Edge-transitive graphs include any complete bipartite graph , and any symmetric graph, such as the vertices and edges of the cube.[1] Symmetric graphs are also vertex-transitive (if they are connected), but in general edge-transitive graphs need not be vertex-transitive. The Gray graph is an example of a graph which is edge-transitive but not vertex-transitive. All such graphs are bipartite,[1] and hence can be colored with only two colors.
An edge-transitive graph that is also regular, but not vertex-transitive, is called semi-symmetric. The Gray graph again provides an example. Every edge-transitive graph must be bipartite and either semi-symmetric or biregular.[2]
A graph with six nodes.
The diagram at right is a graphic representation of the following graph:
V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} E = {{1, 2}, {1, 5}, {2, 3}, {2, 5}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {4, 6}}.
In category theory a small category can be represented by a directed multigraph in which the objects of the category represented as vertices and the morphisms as directed edges. Then, the functors between categories induce some, but not necessarily all, of the digraph morphisms of the graph. In computer science, directed graphs are used to represent knowledge (e.g., Conceptual graph), finite state machines, and many other discrete structures. A binary relation R on a set X defines a directed graph. An element x of X is a direct predecessor of an element y of X iff xRy.
The graph Q0 consists of a single vertex, while Q1 is the complete graph on two vertices and Q2 is a cycle of length 4.
The graph Q3 is the 1-skeleton of a cube, a planar graph with eight vertices and twelve edges.
The graph Q4 is the Levi graph of the Möbius configuration.
Consider the hypergraph with edges

and

Then clearly and are isomorphic (with , etc.), but they are not strongly isomorphic. So, for example, in , vertex meets edges 1, 4 and 6, so that,

In graph , there does not exist any vertex that meets edges 1, 4 and 6:

In this example, and are equivalent, , and the duals are strongly isomorphic: .
The complete graph Kn is integral for all n. The edgeless graph is integral for all n. Among the cubic symmetric graphs the utility graph, the Petersen graph, the Nauru graph and the Desargues graph are integral. The Higman–Sims graph, the Hall–Janko graph, the Clebsch graph, the Hoffman–Singleton graph, the Shrikhande graph and the Hoffman graph are integral.
The median of three vertices in a tree, showing the subtree formed by the union of shortest paths between the vertices.
Any tree is a median graph.[4]  To see this, observe that in a tree, the union of the three shortest paths between any three vertices a, b, and c is either itself a path, or a subtree formed by three paths meeting at a single central node with degree three.  If the union of the three paths is itself a path, the median m(a,b,c) is equal to one of a, b, or c, whichever of these three vertices is between the other two in the path.  If the subtree formed by the union of the three paths is not a path, the median of the three vertices is the central degree-three node of the subtree.
Additional examples of median graphs are provided by the grid graphs.  In a grid graph, the coordinates of the median m(a,b,c) can be found as the median of the coordinates of a, b, and c.  Conversely, it turns out that, in any median graph, one may label the vertices by points in an integer lattice in such a way that medians can be calculated coordinatewise in this way.[5]
A squaregraph.
Squaregraphs, planar graphs in which all interior faces are quadrilaterals and all interior vertices have four or more incident edges, are another subclass of the median graphs.[6]  A polyomino is a special case of a squaregraph and therefore also forms a median graph.
The simplex graph κ(G) of any undirected graph G has a node for every clique (complete subgraph) of G; two nodes are linked by an edge if the corresponding cliques differ by one vertex.  The median of any three cliques may be formed by using the majority rule to determine which vertices of the cliques to include; the simplex graph is a median graph in which this rule determines the median of any three vertices.
No cycle graph of length other than four can be a median graph, because any such cycle has three vertices a, b, and c such that the three shortest paths wrap all the way around the cycle without having a common intersection.  For such a triple of vertices, there can be no median.
The complete signed graph on n vertices with loops, denoted by ±Kno, has every possible positive and negative edge including negative loops, but no positive loops. Its edges correspond to the roots of the root system Cn; the column of an edge in the incidence matrix (see below) is the vector representing the root.
The complete signed graph with half-edges, ±Kn', is ±Kn with a half-edge at every vertex. Its edges correspond to the roots of the root system Bn, half-edges corresponding to the unit basis vectors.
The complete signed link graph, ±Kn, is the same but without loops. Its edges correspond to the roots of the root system Dn.
An all-positive signed graph has only positive edges. If the underlying graph is G, the all-positive signing is written +G.
An all-negative signed graph has only negative edges. It is balanced if and only if it is bipartite because a circle is positive if and only if it has even length. An all-negative graph with underlying graph G is written �?i>G.
A signed complete graph has as underlying graph G the ordinary complete graph Kn. It may have any signs. Signed complete graphs are equivalent to two-graphs, which are of value in finite group theory. A two-graph can be defined as the class of vertex sets of negative triangles in a signed complete graph.
A graph with six nodes.
The diagram at right is a graphic representation of the following graph:
V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} E = {{1, 2}, {1, 5}, {2, 3}, {2, 5}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {4, 6}}.
In category theory a small category can be represented by a directed multigraph in which the objects of the category represented as vertices and the morphisms as directed edges.

The cycle of length 5 is an srg(5,2,0,1). The Petersen graph is an srg(10,3,0,1). The Clebsch graph is an srg(16,5,0,2). The Shrikhande graph is an srg(16,6,2,2) which is not a distance-transitive graph. The Line graph of Generalized quadrangle GQ(2,4) are srg(27,10,1,5).

The Paley graph of order q is an srg(q, (q �?#160;1)/2, (q �?#160;5)/4, (q �?#160;1)/4). The n × n square rook's graph is an srg(n2, 2n �?#160;2, n �?#160;2, 2).
A strongly regular graph is called primitive if both the graph and its complement are connected. All the above graphs are primitive, as otherwise μ=0 or μ=k.
Combining the symmetry condition with the restriction that graphs be cubic (i.e. all vertices have degree 3) yields quite a strong condition, and such graphs are rare enough to be listed. The Foster census and its extensions provide such lists.[7] The Foster census was begun in the 1930s by Ronald M. Foster while he was employed by Bell Labs,[8] and in 1988 (when Foster was 92[1]) the then current Foster census (listing all cubic symmetric graphs up to 512 vertices) was published in book form.[9] The first thirteen items in the list are cubic symmetric graphs with up to 30 vertices[10][11] (ten of these are also distance transitive; the exceptions are as indicated):

Other well known cubic symmetric graphs are the Dyck graph, the Foster graph and the Biggs–Smith graph. The ten distance-transitive graphs listed above, together with the Foster graph and the Biggs–Smith graph, are the only cubic distance-transitive graphs.
Non-cubic symmetric graphs include cycle graphs (of degree 2), complete graphs (of degree 4 or more when there are 5 or more vertices), hypercube graphs (of degree 4 or more when there are 16 or more vertices), and the graphs formed by the vertices and edges of the octahedron, icosahedron, cuboctahedron, and icosidodecahedron. The Rado graph forms an example of a symmetric graph with infinitely many vertices and infinite degree.
