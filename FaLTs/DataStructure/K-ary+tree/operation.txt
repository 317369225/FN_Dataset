Deletion is the process whereby a node is removed from the tree. Only certain nodes in a binary tree can be removed unambiguously.[6]
Nodes can be inserted into binary trees in between two other nodes or added after an external node. In binary trees, a node that is inserted is specified as to which child it is.
There are a variety of different operations that can be performed on binary trees. Some are mutator operations, while others simply return useful information about the tree.

Deletion is the process whereby a node is removed from the tree. Only certain nodes in a binary tree can be removed unambiguously.
Nodes can be inserted into ternary trees in between three other nodes or added after an external node. In Ternary trees, a node that is inserted is specified as to which child it is.
