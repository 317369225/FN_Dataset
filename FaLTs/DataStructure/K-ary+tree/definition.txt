A directed edge refers to the link from the parent to the child (the arrows in the picture of the tree). The root node of a tree is the node with no parents. There is at most one root node in a rooted tree. A leaf node has no children. The depth of a node n is the length of the path from the root to the node. The set of all nodes at a given depth is sometimes called a level of the tree. The root node is at depth zero. The depth (or height) of a tree is the length of the path from the root to the deepest node in the tree. A (rooted) tree with only one node (the root) has a depth of zero. Siblings are nodes that share the same parent node. A node p is an ancestor of a node q if it exists on the path from the root to node q. The node q is then termed as a descendant of p. The size of a node is the number of descendants it has including itself. In-degree of a node is the number of edges arriving at that node. Out-degree of a node is the number of edges leaving that node. The root is the only node in the tree with In-degree = 0. All the leaf nodes have Out-degree = 0.

Directed Edge - The link from the parent to the child. Root - The node with no parents. There is at most one root node in a rooted tree. Leaf Node - The node which has no children. Child Node - The nodes that are located underneath of a node. Depth - Length of the path from the root to the node. The set of all nodes at a given depth is sometimes called a level of the tree. The root node is at depth zero. Height - Length of the path from the root to the deepest node in the tree. A (rooted) tree with only one node (the root) has a height of zero. In the example diagram, the tree has height of 2. Sibling - Nodes that share the same parent node.
- A node p is an ancestor of a node q if it exists on the path from q to the root. The node q is then termed a descendant of p.
- A size of a node is the number of descendants it has including itself.
A free tree or unrooted tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles. The vertices with one neighbor are the leaves of the tree, and the remaining vertices are the internal nodes of the tree. The degree of a vertex is its number of neighbors; in a tree with more than one node, the leaves are the vertices of degree one. An unrooted binary tree is a free tree in which all internal nodes have degree exactly three.
In some applications it may make sense to distinguish subtypes of unrooted binary trees: a planar embedding of the tree may be fixed by specifying a cyclic ordering for the edges at each vertex, making it into a plane tree. In computer science, binary trees are often rooted and ordered when they are used as data structures, but in the applications of unrooted binary trees in hierarchical clustering and evolutionary tree reconstruction, unordered trees are more common.[1]
Additionally, one may distinguish between trees in which all vertices have distinct labels, trees in which the leaves only are labeled, and trees in which the nodes are not labeled. In an unrooted binary tree with n leaves, there will be n �?#160;2 internal nodes, so the labels may be taken from the set of integers from 1 to 2n �?#160;1 when all nodes are to be labeled, or from the set of integers from 1 to n when only the leaves are to be labeled.[1]
