The Desargues graph is the Levi graph of the Desargues configuration, composed of 10 points and 10 lines. There are 3 points on each line, and 3 lines passing through each point. The Desargues graph can also be viewed as the generalized Petersen graph G(10,3) or the bipartite Kneser graph with parameters 5,2. It is 3-regular with 20 vertices.
The Heawood graph is the Levi graph of the Fano plane. It is also known as the (3,6)-cage, and is 3-regular with 14 vertices.
The Möbius–Kantor graph is the Levi graph of the Möbius–Kantor configuration, a system of 8 points and 8 lines that cannot be realized by straight lines in the Euclidean plane. It is 3-regular with 16 vertices.
The Pappus graph is the Levi graph of the Pappus configuration, composed of 9 points and 9 lines. Like the Desargues configuration there are 3 points on each line and 3 lines passing through each point. It is 3-regular with 18 vertices.
The Gray graph is the Levi graph of a configuration that can be realized in R3 as a 3×3×3 grid of 27 points and the 27 orthogonal lines through them.
The Tutte eight-cage is the Levi graph of the Cremona–Richmond configuration. It is also known as the (3,8)-cage, and is 3-regular with 30 vertices.
The four-dimensional hypercube graph Q4 is the Levi graph of the Möbius configuration formed by the points and planes of two mutually incident tetrahedra.
The Ljubljana graph on 112 vertices is the Levi graph of the Ljubljana configuration.[5]
The graph Q0 consists of a single vertex, while Q1 is the complete graph on two vertices and Q2 is a cycle of length 4.
The graph Q3 is the 1-skeleton of a cube, a planar graph with eight vertices and twelve edges.
The graph Q4 is the Levi graph of the Möbius configuration.
