The Cayley Graph was first considered for finite groups by Cayley in 1878.[5] Max Dehn in his unpublished lectures on group theory from 1909-10 reintroduced Cayley graphs under the name Gruppenbild (group diagram), which led to the geometric group theory of today. His most important application was the solution of the word problem for the fundamental group of surfaces with genus �?2, which is equivalent to the topological problem of deciding which closed curves on the surface contract to a point.[6]
The Ljubljana graph was first published in 1993 by Brouwer, Dejter and Thomassen.[4]
In 1972, Bouwer was already talking of a 112-vertices edge- but not vertex-transitive cubic graph found by R. M. Foster, but unpublished.[5] Conder, Malnič, Marušič, Pisanski and Potočnik rediscovered this 112-vertices graph in 2002 and named it the Ljubljana graph after the capital of Slovenia.[2] They proved that it was the unique 112-vertices edge- but not vertex-transitive cubic graph and therefore that was the graph found by Foster.
The first person to write about the Nauru graph was R. M. Foster in an effort to collect all the cubic symmetric graphs.[9] The whole list of the cubic symmetric graph is now named after him as the Foster Census and inside this list the Nauru graph is numbered as graph F24A but has no specific name.[10] In 1950, H. S. M. Coxeter cited the graph a second time, giving the Hamiltonian representation used to illustrate this article and describing it as the Levi graph of a projective configuration discovered by Zacharias.[11][12]
In 2003, Ed Pegg wrote in his online MAA column that F24A deserves a name but did not propose one.[13] Finally, in 2007, David Eppstein used the name Nauru graph because the flag of the Republic of Nauru has a 12-point star similar to the one that appears in the construction of the graph as a generalized Petersen graph.[1]
Outerplanar graphs were first studied and named by Chartrand & Harary (1967), in connection with the problem of determining the planarity of graphs formed by using a perfect matching to connect two copies of a base graph (for instance, many of the generalized Petersen graphs are formed in this way from two copies of a cycle graph). As they showed, when the base graph is biconnected, a graph constructed in this way is planar if and only if its base graph is outerplanar and the matching forms a dihedral permutation of its outer cycle.
Random graphs were first defined by Paul Erdős and Alfréd Rényi in their 1959 paper "On Random Graphs"[6] and independently by Gilbert in his paper "Random graphs".[7]
