Search algorithms can be classified based on their mechanism of searching.  Linear search algorithms check every record for the one associated with a target key in a linear fashion.[3][4] Binary, or half interval searches, repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. Comparison search algorithms improve on linear searching by successively eliminating records based on comparisons of the keys until the target record is found, and can be applied on data structures with a defined order.[4] Digital search algorithms work based on the properties of digits in data structures that use numerical keys.[5] Finally, hashing directly maps keys to records based on a hash function.[6] Searches outside of a linear search require that the data be sorted in some way.
