Although the basic idea of binary search is comparatively straightforward, the details can be surprisingly tricky�?�?Donald Knuth[6]
When Jon Bentley assigned it as a problem in a course for professional programmers, he found that an astounding ninety percent failed to code a binary search correctly after several hours of working on it,[7] and another study shows that accurate code for it is only found in five out of twenty textbooks.[8] Furthermore, Bentley's own implementation of binary search, published in his 1986 book Programming Pearls, contains an error that remained undetected for over twenty years.[9]
