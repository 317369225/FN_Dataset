Prove: (a, b) = (c, d) if and only if a = c and b = d.
Kuratowski: If. If a = c and b = d, then {{a}, {a, b}} = {{c}, {c, d}}. Thus (a, b)K = (c, d)K.
Only if. Two cases: a = b, and a �?b.
If a = b:
(a, b)K = {{a}, {a, b}} = {{a}, {a, a}} = {{a}}. (c, d)K = {{c}, {c, d}} = {{a}}. Thus {c} = {c, d} = {a}, which implies a = c and a = d. By hypothesis, a = b. Hence b = d.
If a �?b, then (a, b)K = (c, d)K implies {{a}, {a, b}} = {{c}, {c, d}}.
Suppose {c, d} = {a}. Then c = d = a, and so {{c}, {c, d}} = {{a}, {a, a}} = {{a}, {a}} = {{a}}. But then {{a}, {a, b}} would also equal {{a}}, so that b = a which contradicts a �?b.
Suppose {c} = {a, b}. Then a = b = c, which also contradicts a �?b.
Therefore {c} = {a}, so that c = a and {c, d} = {a, b}.
If d = a were true, then {c, d} = {a, a} = {a} �?{a, b}, a contradiction. Thus d = b is the case, so that a = c and b = d.
Reverse: (a, b)reverse = {{b}, {a, b}} = {{b}, {b, a}} = (b, a)K.
If. If (a, b)reverse = (c, d)reverse, (b, a)K = (d, c)K. Therefore b = d and a = c.
Only if. If a = c and b = d, then {{b}, {a, b}} = {{d}, {c, d}}. Thus (a, b)reverse = (c, d)reverse.

If: Obvious.
Only if: Suppose {a, {a, b}} = {c, {c, d}}. Then a is in the left hand side, and thus in the right hand side. Because equal sets have equal elements, one of a = c or a = {c, d} must be the case.
If a = {c, d}, then by similar reasoning as above, {a, b} is in the right hand side, so {a, b} = c or {a, b} = {c, d}.
If {a, b} = c then c is in {c, d} = a and a is in c, and this combination contradicts the axiom of regularity, as {a, c} has no minimal element under the relation "element of." If {a, b} = {c, d}, then a is an element of a, from a = {c, d} = {a, b}, again contradicting regularity.
Hence a = c must hold.
Again, we see that {a, b} = c or {a, b} = {c, d}.
The option {a, b} = c and a = c implies that c is an element of c, contradicting regularity. So we have a = c and {a, b} = {c, d}, and so: {b} = {a, b} \ {a} = {c, d} \ {c} = {d}, so b = d.
