A sequence is usually defined as a function whose domain is a countable totally ordered set, although in many disciplines the domain is restricted, such as to the natural numbers. In real analysis a sequence is a function from a subset of the natural numbers to the real numbers.[1] In other words, a sequence is a map . To recover our earlier notation we might identify Â  or just write .
In complex analysis sequences are defined as maps from the natural numbers to the complex numbers ().[2] In topology, sequences are often defined as functions from a subset of the natural numbers to a topological space.[3] Sequences are an important concept for studying functions and, in topology, topological spaces. An important generalization of sequences, called a net, is to functions from a (possibly uncountable) directed set to a topological space.
