A tiling with squares whose sides are successive Fibonacci numbers in length
There are many important integer sequences. The prime numbers are numbers that have no divisors but 1 and themselves. Taking these in their natural order gives the sequence {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,...}. The study of prime numbers has important applications for mathematics and specifically number theory.
The Fibonacci numbers are formed from the integer sequence whose elements are formed by taking the sum of the previous two elements. The first two elements are defined either as 0 and 1 or 1 and 1 giving the sequence {0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,...}.
Other interesting sequences include the ban numbers, whose spellings do not contain a certain letter of the alphabet. For instance, the eban numbers (do not contain 'e') form the sequence {2,4,6,30,32,34,36,40,42,...}. Another sequence based on the English spelling of the letters is the one based on their number of letters {3,3,5,4,4,3,5,5,4,3,6,6,8,...}.
For a list of important examples of integers sequences see On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.
Other important examples of sequences include ones made up of rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers. The sequence {.9,.99,.999,.9999,...} approaches the number one. In fact, every real number can be written as the limit of a sequence of rational number. For instance, the number π can be written as the limit of a sequence {3,3.1,3.14,3.141,3.1415,...}. In fact, every real number can be written as an decimal. The decimal for π, however, does not have any pattern like the one for the sequence {0.9,0.99,...}.
