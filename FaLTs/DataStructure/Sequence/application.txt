Important results for convergence and limits of (one-sided) sequences of real numbers include the following. Note that these equalities are all true at least when both sides exist. For a discussion of when the existence of the limit on one side implies the existence of the the other see a real analysis text such as can be found in the references.[1][5]
The limit of a sequence is unique. provided If for all n greater than some N, then (Squeeze Theorem) If for all n>N, and , Â  then . If a sequence is bounded and monotonic then it is convergent. A sequence is convergent if and only if every subsequence is convergent.
