To insert the value "25" into this 2�?�? tree:

Begin at the root (10, 20) and descend towards the rightmost child (22, 24, 29). (Its interval (20, �? contains 25.) Node (22, 24, 29) is a 4-node, so its middle element 24 is pushed up into the parent node.

The remaining 3-node (22, 29) is split into a pair of 2-nodes (22) and (29). Ascend back into the new parent (10, 20, 24). Descend towards the rightmost child (29). (Its interval (24, �? contains 25.)

Node (29) has no leftmost child. (The child for interval (�? 29) is empty.) Stop here and insert value 25 into this node.

The input is: a b + c d e + * *
Since the first two symbols are operands, one-node trees are created and pointers are pushed to them onto a stack. For convenience the stack will grow from left to right.

Stack growing from Left to Right
The next symbol is a '+'. It pops the two pointers to the trees, a new tree is formed, and a pointer to it is pushed onto to the stack.
Formation of a New Tree
Next, c, d, and e are read. A one-node tree is created for each and a pointer to the corresponding tree is pushed onto the stack.
Creating One-Node Tree

Continuing, a '+' is read, and it merges the last two trees.
Merging Two Trees
Now, a '*' is read. The last two tree pointers are popped and a new tree is formed with a '*' as the root.
Forming a New Tree with a Root
Finally, the last symbol is read. The two trees are merged and a pointer to the final tree remains on the stack.[5]
Steps to Construct an Expression tree a b + c d e + * *

To search for an interval, you walk the tree, omitting those branches which can't contain what you're looking for. The simple case is looking for a point:
// Search for all intervals which contain "p", starting with the
 // node "n" and adding matching intervals to the list "result"
 public void search(IntervalNode n, Point p, List<Interval> result) {
     // Don't search nodes that don't exist
     if (n == null)
         return;
 
     // If p is to the right of the rightmost point of any interval
     // in this node and all children, there won't be any matches.
     if (p.compareTo(n.getValue()) > 0)
         return;
 
     // Search left children
     if (n.getLeft() != null)
         search(IntervalNode (n.getLeft()), p, result);
 
     // Check this node
     if (n.getKey().contains(p))
         result.add(n.getKey());
 
     // If p is to the left of the start of this interval,
     // then it can't be in any child to the right.
     if (p.compareTo(n.getKey().getStart()) < 0)
         return;
 
     // Otherwise, search right children
     if (n.getRight() != null)
         search(IntervalNode (n.getRight()), p, result);
 }
The code to search for an interval is exactly the same except for the check in the middle:
// Check this node
 if (n.getKey().overlapsWith(i))
     result.add (n.getKey());
overlapsWith() is defined as:
public boolean overlapsWith(Interval other) {
     return start.compareTo(other.getEnd()) <= 0 &&
            end.compareTo(other.getStart()) >= 0;
 }
MindManager and MindMapper are mindmapping systems, which can make radial-like layouts, though are not radial beyond the 2nd level. SpicyNodes is an approach to visualizing hierarchies, which allows moving from node to node.
Ternary search tree Ternary heap An infinite ternary tree containing all primitive Pythagorean triples is described in Tree of primitive Pythagorean triples and in Formulas for generating Pythagorean triples. The root node contains triple [3,4,5].[2]
