There are many well-known methods by which an array can be sorted, which include, but are not limited to: selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, heapsort, and counting sort.[citation needed] These sorting techniques have different algorithms associated with them, and there are therefore different advantages to using each method.
