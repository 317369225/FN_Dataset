The ReiserFS, NSS, XFS, JFS, ReFS, and BFS filesystems all use this type of tree for metadata indexing; BFS also uses B+ trees for storing directories. NTFS uses B+ trees for directory indexing. EXT4 uses extent trees (a modified B+ tree data structure) for file extent indexing.[3] Relational database management systems such as IBM DB2,[4] Informix,[4] Microsoft SQL Server,[4] Oracle 8,[4] Sybase ASE,[4] and SQLite[5] support this type of tree for table indices. Key-value database management systems such as CouchDB[6] and Tokyo Cabinet[7] support this type of tree for data access.
