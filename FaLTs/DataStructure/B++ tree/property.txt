The primary value of a B+ tree is in storing data for efficient retrieval in a block-oriented storage context ¡ª in particular, filesystems. This is primarily because unlike binary search trees, B+ trees have very high fanout (number of pointers to child nodes in a node,[1] typically on the order of 100 or more), which reduces the number of I/O operations required to find an element in the tree.
