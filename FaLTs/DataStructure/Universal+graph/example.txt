A schematic picture of the skip list data structure. Each box with an arrow represents a pointer and a row is a linked list giving a sparse subsequence; the numbered boxes at the bottom represent the ordered data sequence. Searching proceeds downwards from the sparsest subsequence at the top until consecutive elements bracketing the search element are found.
