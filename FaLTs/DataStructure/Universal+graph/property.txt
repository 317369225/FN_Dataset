A universal graph for a family F of graphs can also refer to a member of a sequence of finite graphs that contains all graphs in F; for instance, every finite tree is a subgraph of a sufficiently large hypercube graph[5] so a hypercube can be said to be a universal graph for trees. However it is not the smallest such graph: it is known that there is a universal graph for n-node trees with only n vertices and O(n log n) edges, and that this is optimal.[6] A construction based on the planar separator theorem can be used to show that n-vertex planar graphs have universal graphs with O(n3/2) edges, and that bounded-degree planar graphs have universal graphs with O(n log n) edges.[7][8][9] Sumner's conjecture states that tournaments are universal for polytrees, in the sense that every tournament with 2n ? 2 vertices contains every polytree with n vertices as a subgraph.[10]

A family F of graphs has a universal graph of polynomial size, containing every n-vertex graph as an induced subgraph, if and only if it has an adjacency labelling scheme in which vertices may be labeled by O(log n)-bit bitstrings such that an algorithm can determine whether two vertices are adjacent by examining their labels. For, if a universal graph of this type exists, the vertices of any graph in F may be labeled by the identities of the corresponding vertices in the universal graph, and conversely if a labeling scheme exists then a universal graph may be constructed having a vertex for every possible label.[11]

In older mathematical terminology, the phrase "universal graph" was sometimes used to denote a complete graph.
