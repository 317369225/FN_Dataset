Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon who used what John McCarthy calls an "approximation"[2] in 1958 wrote that alpha–beta "appears to have been reinvented a number of times".[3] Arthur Samuel had an early version and Richards, Hart, Levine and/or Edwards found alpha–beta independently in the United States.[4] McCarthy proposed similar ideas during the Dartmouth Conference in 1956 and suggested it to a group of his students including Alan Kotok at MIT in 1961.[5] Alexander Brudno independently discovered the alpha–beta algorithm, publishing his results in 1963.[6] Donald Knuth and Ronald W. Moore refined the algorithm in 1975[7][8] and Judea Pearl proved its optimality in 1982.[9]
The quicksort algorithm was developed in 1960 by Tony Hoare while in the Soviet Union, as a visiting student at Moscow State University. At that time, Hoare worked in a project on machine translation for the National Physical Laboratory. He developed the algorithm in order to sort the words to be translated, to make them more easily matched to an already-sorted Russian-to-English dictionary that was stored on magnetic tape.[3]
