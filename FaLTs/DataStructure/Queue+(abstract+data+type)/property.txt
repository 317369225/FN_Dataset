This is one useful application of stacks. Consider that a freight train has n railroad cars, each to be left at different station. They're numbered 1 through n and freight train visits these stations in order n through 1. Obviously, the railroad cars are labeled by their destination. To facilitate removal of the cars from the train, we must rearrange them in ascending order of their number (i.e. 1 through n). When cars are in this order, they can be detached at each station. We rearrange cars at a shunting yard that has input track, output track and k holding tracks between input & output tracks (i.e. holding track).
