The original algorithm to solve this key problem was exponential with the dimensionality and thus not feasible[1] ("GetNextZ-address"). A solution to this "crucial part of the UB-tree range query" linear with the z-address bit length has been described later.[2] This method has already been described in an older paper[3] where using Z-order with search trees has first been proposed.
