Following code shows how to implement a binary search tree in Java:
This is easily expressed as a recursive algorithm (implemented in Python):

def search_recursively(key, node):

    if node is None or node.key == key:

        return node

    elif key < node.key:

        return search_recursively(key, node.left)

    else:  # key > node.key

        return search_recursively(key, node.right)
