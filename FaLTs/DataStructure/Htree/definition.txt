According to Knuth's definition, a B-tree of order m (the maximum number of children for each node) is a tree which satisfies the following properties:
Every node has at most m children. Every non-leaf node (except root) has at least �?span class="frac nowrap">m�?sub>2�?children. The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf node. A non-leaf node with k children contains k�? keys. All leaves appear in the same level, and carry information.
Each internal node’s keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees. For example, if an internal node has 3 child nodes (or subtrees) then it must have 2 keys: a1 and a2. All values in the leftmost subtree will be less than a1, all values in the middle subtree will be between a1 and a2, and all values in the rightmost subtree will be greater than a2.
Internal nodes Internal nodes are all nodes except for leaf nodes and the root node. They are usually represented as an ordered set of elements and child pointers. Every internal node contains a maximum of U children and a minimum of L children. Thus, the number of elements is always 1 less than the number of child pointers (the number of elements is between L�? and U�?). U must be either 2L or 2L�?; therefore each internal node is at least half full. The relationship between U and L implies that two half-full nodes can be joined to make a legal node, and one full node can be split into two legal nodes (if there’s room to push one element up into the parent). These properties make it possible to delete and insert new values into a B-tree and adjust the tree to preserve the B-tree properties.
The root node The root node’s number of children has the same upper limit as internal nodes, but has no lower limit. For example, when there are fewer than L�? elements in the entire tree, the root will be the only node in the tree, with no children at all.
Leaf nodes Leaf nodes have the same restriction on the number of elements, but have no children, and no child pointers.
A B-tree of depth n+1 can hold about U times as many items as a B-tree of depth n, but the cost of search, insert, and delete operations grows with the depth of the tree. As with any balanced tree, the cost grows much more slowly than the number of elements.
Some balanced trees store values only at leaf nodes, and use different kinds of nodes for leaf nodes and internal nodes. B-trees keep values in every node in the tree, and may use the same structure for all nodes. However, since leaf nodes never have children, the B-trees benefit from improved performance if they use a specialized structure.

A directed edge refers to the link from the parent to the child (the arrows in the picture of the tree). The root node of a tree is the node with no parents. There is at most one root node in a rooted tree. A leaf node has no children. The depth of a node n is the length of the path from the root to the node. The set of all nodes at a given depth is sometimes called a level of the tree. The root node is at depth zero. The depth (or height) of a tree is the length of the path from the root to the deepest node in the tree. A (rooted) tree with only one node (the root) has a depth of zero. Siblings are nodes that share the same parent node. A node p is an ancestor of a node q if it exists on the path from the root to node q. The node q is then termed as a descendant of p. The size of a node is the number of descendants it has including itself. In-degree of a node is the number of edges arriving at that node. Out-degree of a node is the number of edges leaving that node. The root is the only node in the tree with In-degree = 0. All the leaf nodes have Out-degree = 0.
The suffix tree for the string of length is defined as a tree such that:[2]
the paths from the root to the leaves have a one-to-one relationship with the suffixes of , edges spell non-empty strings, and all internal nodes (except perhaps the root) have at least two children.
Since such a tree does not exist for all strings, is padded with a terminal symbol not seen in the string (usually denoted $). This ensures that no suffix is a prefix of another, and that there will be leaf nodes, one for each of the suffixes of . Since all internal non-root nodes are branching, there can be at most n �?#160; 1 such nodes, and n + (n �?#160;1) + 1 = 2n nodes in total (n leaves, n �?#160;1 internal nodes, 1 root).
Suffix links are a key feature for older linear-time construction algorithms, although most newer algorithms, which are based on Farach's algorithm, dispense with suffix links. In a complete suffix tree, all internal non-root nodes have a suffix link to another internal node. If the path from the root to a node spells the string , where is a single character and is a string (possibly empty), it has a suffix link to the internal node representing . See for example the suffix link from the node for ANA to the node for NA in the figure above. Suffix links are also used in some algorithms running on the tree.
Directed Edge - The link from the parent to the child. Root - The node with no parents. There is at most one root node in a rooted tree. Leaf Node - The node which has no children. Child Node - The nodes that are located underneath of a node. Depth - Length of the path from the root to the node. The set of all nodes at a given depth is sometimes called a level of the tree. The root node is at depth zero. Height - Length of the path from the root to the deepest node in the tree. A (rooted) tree with only one node (the root) has a height of zero. In the example diagram, the tree has height of 2. Sibling - Nodes that share the same parent node.
- A node p is an ancestor of a node q if it exists on the path from q to the root. The node q is then termed a descendant of p.
- A size of a node is the number of descendants it has including itself.
A free tree or unrooted tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles. The vertices with one neighbor are the leaves of the tree, and the remaining vertices are the internal nodes of the tree. The degree of a vertex is its number of neighbors; in a tree with more than one node, the leaves are the vertices of degree one. An unrooted binary tree is a free tree in which all internal nodes have degree exactly three.
In some applications it may make sense to distinguish subtypes of unrooted binary trees: a planar embedding of the tree may be fixed by specifying a cyclic ordering for the edges at each vertex, making it into a plane tree. In computer science, binary trees are often rooted and ordered when they are used as data structures, but in the applications of unrooted binary trees in hierarchical clustering and evolutionary tree reconstruction, unordered trees are more common.[1]
Additionally, one may distinguish between trees in which all vertices have distinct labels, trees in which the leaves only are labeled, and trees in which the nodes are not labeled. In an unrooted binary tree with n leaves, there will be n �?#160;2 internal nodes, so the labels may be taken from the set of integers from 1 to 2n �?#160;1 when all nodes are to be labeled, or from the set of integers from 1 to n when only the leaves are to be labeled.[1]
