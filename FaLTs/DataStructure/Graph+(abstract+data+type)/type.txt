The basic operations provided by a graph data structure G usually include:
adjacent(G, x, y): tests whether there is an edge from node x to node y. neighbors(G, x): lists all nodes y such that there is an edge from x to y. add(G, x, y): adds to G the edge from x to y, if it is not there. delete(G, x, y): removes the edge from x to y, if it is there. get_node_value(G, x): returns the value associated with the node x. set_node_value(G, x, a): sets the value associated with the node x to a.
Structures that associate values to the edges usually also provide:
get_edge_value(G, x, y): returns the value associated to the edge (x,y). set_edge_value(G, x, y, v): sets the value associated to the edge (x,y) to v.
